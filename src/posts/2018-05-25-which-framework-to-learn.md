We're going to do things differently in this video.

I want to walk you through a few questions. For each question, I want you to pause the video and write down your answer to the question on a piece of paper. Do it before you listen to the next question.

If you answer the questions, you will be able to figure out which framework you should learn, and how to start learning it.

## The first question

What's your goal? Why are you trying to learn a framework?

Be honest with yourself with this answer. Pause the video and answer the question.

## The second question

Which framework will help you get to your goal?

List every framework that comes to mind.

List any other solutions besides frameworks that come to your mind.

Pause the video and answer the question.

## The third question

Which framework will or solution do you want to try out the most?

Pick one. Just one.

List your reasons.

Pause the video and answer the question.

## The fourth question

What is stopping you from learning that framework?

List everything you can think of.

Pause the video and answer the question.

## The fifth question

What's the worst that can happen if you learn that framework?

What will you do if that worst case scenario happens?

Pause the video and answer the question.

## The sixth question

What's the smallest possible step you can do to reach the goal?

Once you're done, list five more steps.

Pause the video and answer the question.

## That's the end of all questions.

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter which framework you pick. What's important is you fulfill the goal you're trying to reach.

Frameworks are just tools. You can use any tool you want. They don't matter. Decide on one and move on.
