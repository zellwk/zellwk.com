Bootcamps are fast-paced learning environments.

Most people who enroll in a Bootcamp do quite well when it comes to HTML and CSS. But many people struggle with JavaScript. Some even get depressed about programming because they can't understand JavaScript.

If you're one of these people, I want to let you know that you're not alone. I receive emails from people like yourself occasionally.

Here's one I received from Seth.

<figure role="figure"><img src="/images/2019/bootcamp/seth.png" alt="Email says: I joined this coding bootcamp mid August and I was so much green to programming. I was really motivated and have been having so much interest in programming for quite a while now. I have been learning Javascript since I enrolled and I have grasped a little concept but right now I feel like QUITING, AM GIVING UP on coding. I don't feel the motivation anymore like I no longer get what the facilitator is saying. I really dont feel being in that bootcamp anymore. "></figure>

## Two options

If you enrolled in a Bootcamp and you're struggling to catch up, (especially with JavaScript), you have two choices:

1. Stay on
2. Quit

Both are valid options.

## Option 1: Stay on

The good thing about staying on is you get exposed to how people do things on an advanced level. This helps when you're trying to learn advanced stuff in the future.

You will probably remain confused. And you may think you learned nothing while you're in the Bootcamp. But the learnings stick for longer than you give it credit for.

For example, let's say you joined a Bootcamp that teaches you to become a Full Stack developer. In the Bootcamp, they teach you how to use Express and MongoDB to create a backend. You don't remember much of this.

Let's say you feel ready to build apps a year after the Bootcamp. At this point, you know (roughly) what to use. You'll reach for Express and MongoDB straightaway. This shaves off a huge amount of time [choosing a language][1].

You'll also know the basics of the language. You'll roughly know how to structure your code. This takes off a huge amount of time from browsing online tutorials.

## Option Two: Quit

Our culture devalues quitting. You're labeled as stupid and useless if you quit. But that can't be farther from the truth.

Successful people quit all the time. They quit things that do not forward them. If the Bootcamp doesn't forward you in the direction you want to go in, then it's best to quit.

Also if you’re beating yourself up too hard, choosing to leave is a good option. If you leave, you will be able to focus your energies on the fundamentals and re-learn from there.

## Which to choose?

Both are valid options. What you need depends on your current state. I won’t be able to help you make a decision. You must make it yourself.

**Whatever you choose, don’t give up coding.** Continue to learn. Everyone can code. You too.

All the best :)
