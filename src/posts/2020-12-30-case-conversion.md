I got fed up searching Google for case conversion utilities. The useful ones I found ([Voca](https://vocajs.com) and [change-case](https://www.npmjs.com/package/change-case)) both require an environment that allows me to use npm.   

But I was using Vanilla JavaScript. I did not want to include any toolchains in this project, and I'm reluctant to send an asynchronous request to download a module just for case-conversion. 

So I decided to write a set of conversion utilities myself. 

It's simpler than I thought.   

## The Common Cases  

I usually use these cases when writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:   
  - `camelCase`  
  - `kebab-case`  
  - `Sentence case`  
  - `Title Case`  

I don't use these two cases, but I know they exist.   
  - `snake_case`  
  - `PascalCase`  

So far, I've relied on simple functions that convert from one case to another. But I was fed up with writing things like `camelToTitle` or `camelToKebab`. It's much nicer to have a function that converts all cases to the one I need. 

## Converting any case to kebab-case   

I started converting stuff into `kebab-case` because that was what I needed when I searched for case conversion utilities.   

To convert all cases into `kebab-case`, I had to consider the possible cases. Here are the cases once again:   

  - `camelCase`  
  - `PascalCase`  
  - `snake_case`  
  - `Sentence case`  
  - `Title Case`  

Converting `snake_case`, `Sentence case` and `Title Case` into `kebab-case` is easy. I only need to do two things:   

  1. Lowercase everything
  2. Replace `_` and spaces with `-`  

But I cannot begin by lowercasing everything if I wanted to support case conversion from `camelCase` and `PascalCase`. I would lose the word-break point.   

So I had to begin by searching for the capital letters which denote the start of a new word (for `camelCase` and `PascalCase`). The easiest way is to loop through each letter and run a simple `/[A-Z]/` regex. This regex searches for any letter that's between A and Z.   

```javascript
function toKebab (string) {
  return string
    .split('')
    .map((letter, index) => {
      if (/[A-Z]/.test(letter)) {
        // Capital letters
      }
      return letter
    })
    .join('')
}
```  

Then I lowercased the capital letters and added a space in front of them. (It doesn't matter whether I add space or `_`, both are fine since I'm going to replace them with `-` later).   

```javascript
function toKebab (string) {
  return string
    .split('')
    .map((letter, index) => {
      if (/[A-Z]/.test(letter)) {
        return ` ${letter.toLowerCase()}`
      }
      return letter
    })
    .join('')
}
```  

Note: I'm pretty sure there's a regex that can do these three steps in one. It probably uses capturing groups and substitution, which I'm not familiar with. I didn't try it since I didn't have the time nor energy to research further. If you know a good regex for this, let me know!   

This step converts the cases into the following:   

  - `camel case`  
  - ` pascal case`  
  - `snake_case`  
  - ` sentence case`  
  - ` title  case `  

There's a space at the start of some cases. I removed them with 
`trim`.   

```javascript
function toKebab (string) {
  return string
    .split('')
    .map((letter, index) => {
      if (/[A-Z]/.test(letter)) {
        return ` ${letter.toLowerCase()}`
      }
      return letter
    })
    .join('')
    .trim()
}
```  

This gives me the following:   

  - `camel case`  
  - `pascal case`  
  - `snake_case`  
  - `sentence case`  
  - `title  case `  

I can now replace both `_` and spaces with `-`. This can be done with two `replace` calls like this:   

  - 1. First replace uses `/_/g` to replace all occurences of `_`.   
  - 2. Second replace uses `/\s+/` to replace all spaces into `-`. The `+` indicates "one or more", so it matches the two spaces in `title  case`.   

```javascript
export function toKebab (string) {
  return string
    // ...
    .replace(/_/g, '-')
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
}
```  

I can combine both `replace` calls into a single regex with `[]`. The square brackets indicate an OR value.   

```javascript
export function toKebab (string) {
  return string
    // ...
    .replace(/[_\s]+/g, '-')
}
```  

That gives me this:   

  - `camel-case`  
  - `pascal-case`  
  - `snake-case`  
  - `sentence-case`  
  - `title-case`  

It even works for complicated mixed cases too. For example, if you try `case_With-long name` you'll get `case-with-long-name`.     

## Converting anything to Sentence case  

I worked on this utility next since I wanted to convert `camelCase` into `Sentence case`.   

At first, I dreaded the thought of finding the similarities between all 6 cases again. It felt like a lot of work. 

But I realized I can use my `toKebab` function to convert everything into `kebab-case` first. This takes advantage of the work I've already done.   

I was against this idea at first because it seems like a "waste of resources" to run another function first from a performance standpoint. But I realized I was being idealistic. From a practical standpoint, it doesn't have much impact on performance since the operations are really fast.   

```javascript
// Starting with toKebab
function toTitle (string) {
  return toKebab(string)
}
```  

Now I just need to convert `kebab-case` to `Title Case`.   

Here, I only need to do the following:  

  1. Split the string at `-`. This gives me an array of words.   
  2. Capitalize the first letter of each word.   
  3. Join the array with space.  

```javascript
export function toTitle (string) {
  return toKebab(string)
    .split('-')
    .map(word => {
      return word.slice(0, 1).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
    })
    .join(' ')
}
```  

And I'm done!   

## Converting anything into Sentence Case   

It's equally easy to convert all cases into Sentence case. Once again, I started by converting things into `kebab-case`.   

```javascript
export function toSentence (string) {
  return toKebab(string)
}
```  

Now I only need to convert `kebab-case` into `Sentence case`. There are two things to do:  

  - Capitalize the first letter   
  - replace `-` with space.  

I can do either step first. In this case, I chose to do the `replace` step first since I can chain it after `toKebab`.  

```javascript
export function toSentence (string) {
  const interim = toKebab(string)
    .replace(/-/g, ' ')
  return interim.slice(0, 1).toUpperCase() + interim.slice(1)
}
```  

## Convert anything into camelCase  

Finally, I want to be able to convert any string back into camel case.   

I start with `toKebab` as usual.  

```javascript
export function toCamel (string) {
  return toKebab(string)
}
```  

At this point, I only need to convert `kebab-case` into `camelCase`.   

I can do this by:   

1. Splitting the word at each `-`. This creates an array of words.   
2. Loop through the array and capitalize the first letter if it's not the first word.   

```javascript
function toCamel (string) {
  return toKebab(string)
    .split('-')
    .map((word, index) => {
      if (index === 0) return word
      return word.slice(0, 1).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase()
    })
    .join('')
}
```  

Simple as that! 

## Case Conversion Library  

I added these case-conversion utilities into [my JavaScript repository](https://github.com/zellwk/javascript/tree/master/convert-case). You can grab them if you want them :)
