My first task in 2019 is to get a new computer. I didn't want to change computers, but my old one gave way and I had no choice 😭.

Since I'm already switching computers, I thought it'll be interesting to share the apps I use on a daily basis.

I hope you find some of them interesting!

## Apps for writing

I do a lot of writing work (for the blog, and for the courses I make). Here are the apps I use:

1. [Ulysses][1]. This is where I do my idea curation, outlining, drafting, writing, and editing work.
2. [Rocket][2]: Rocket helps me write emojis as if I'm writing them on Slack. For example, to get 😀, I type `:grinning`. It has autocomplete features so typing emojis become a breeze 😁.
3. [Hemingway app][3]: I use Hemingway app to ensure my sentences are easy to read and understand.
4. [Grammarly][4]: I use Grammarly to help me correct any obvious grammatical errors.
5. [Word counter app][5]: This is a menu-bar app that tells me how many words I've written on my computer today. My highest track record is 12,000 words!
6. [Marked 2][6]: I use Marked 2 for converting Markdown (from Ulysses or my text editor, VS Code) into HTML or Rich Text. I then paste Rich Text into the WISYWIG editor in [Convertkit][7] (to send emails).
7. [Skitch][8]: Skitch helps me annotate images quickly for articles.
8. [Kap][9]: Kap helps me make gifs and videos that don't look janky (but the Gifs are quite big...).

## Apps for coding

Of course, coding is a big part of my work. How else do I call myself a developer otherwise? 🤪

1. [Visual Studio Code][10]: My preferred text editor. I created a [video series][11] to help you set up VS Code if you want to use it.
2. [iTerm2:][12] I prefer iTerm2 over the built-in terminal app. It's easier to configure, and I can have split screens (which makes multiple terminal windows easier to manage)\>
3. [Tower][13]: I prefer Tower over other Git clients. If you want to try Tower, you can use `zell20` to get 20% discount off your first year! (I don't get money for sharing this). If you want to learn Git, I have a [video series][14] for you too.
4. [Postman][15]: Postman is good for debugging API.
5. [MongoDB Compass][16]: This is good for checking data stored in my MongoDB Databases.

## Browsers I use

Like any other web developer, I install many browsers on my computer (primarily for testing). Here are the ones I use:

1. Safari: My main browser for browsing
2. [Chrome Canary][17]: My main browser for debugging JavaScript.
3. [Firefox Nightly][18]: My main browser for debugging CSS.
4. [Chrome][19]: For debugging.
5. [Firefox][20]: For debugging.

(I rarely test against IE or Edge nowadays, because there's generally no need to anymore).

## Design Apps

I may not look like it, but I'm also interested in Design. I design every website I build. Here are the tools I use:

1. [Sip][21]: Sip is a simple color dropper tool.
2. [Sketch][22]: For designing
3. [Typeface][23]: For managing typefaces on my Mac. It's much better than font book!
4. [Adobe Fonts][24]: For syncing typefaces from Typekit (now Adobe Fonts) onto my computer.

## Apps for creating videos:

I've been creating videos for \~1 year. Here are the apps I've been using:

1. [Audacity][25]: For recording audio
2. [Screenflow][26]: For recording my screen and face
3. [OBS][27]: For positioning my face on the video. I hope I can use it for live-streaming sometime in the future.
4. [Webcam settings][28]: Lights are set at 50hz over at my part of the world (it's 60hz in USA), so my webcam flickers when recording. This sets it right.

## General productivity apps

Here are some apps I can't live without on my Mac.

1. [Alfred][29]: Alfred is Spotlight + so many things.
2. [Airmail][30]: My preferred email client
3. [Fantastical2][31]: My preferred calendar app
4. [Moom][32]: I use Moom to shift windows around on a Mac.
5. [Notion][33]: I've recently started using Notion as a todo-list system. I may write about this in future if it sticks.
6. [Odrive][34]: For syncing multiple Google Drives
7. [Dropbox][35]: Nothing to say here :)

## Some Social Apps

1. [Messenger][36]
2. [Slack][37]
3. [Telegram][38]
4. [Tweetdeck][39]
5. [Whatsapp][40]
6. [Wechat][41]
7. [Zoom][42] - For video calls

## Miscellaneous apps

1. [1Blocker][43]: Blocking ads and other stuff on Safari.
2. [1Password][44]: Where I store all my password information.
3. [Beamer][45]: To put videos onto my Apple TV.
4. [Clean my mac 3][46]: To remove applications cleanly.
5. [MplayerX][47]: For playing videos.
6. [Spotify][48]: Because. music. rocks.
7. [Vanilla app][49]: For managing the menu bar.
