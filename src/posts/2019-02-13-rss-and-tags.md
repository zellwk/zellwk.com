Many people wanted two things at Zellwk.com:

1. An RSS feed (to get updates without going through emails).
2. An easier way to browse the articles I created.

I finally found the chance to provide these features!

## RSS

You can find my RSS feed on [this page][1].

## An easier way to browse articles

People asked for two features here:

1. Tags
2. Search

I've created the tags for the blog. You can find every tag on [the tags archive page][2].

<figure><img src="/images/2019/rss/tags.png" alt="Image for the tags page"></figure>

This page shows a list of tags for all my blog posts. You'll also see the number of articles that are tagged with a specific tag.

<figure><img src="/images/2019/rss/tag-page.png" alt="Image for each tag page"></figure>

If you click on a tag, you'll see a list of articles. I listed only the title of each article here. I thought it'll be easier for you to browser through everything I've created.

Note: This is a new UX I'm experimenting with. Please let me hear your feedback on it.

## Search

I'm going to implement search with [Agolia][3] when I find the time to. I'll share more about it as I roll it out.

## Wrapping up

I hope the RSS Feed, Tags (and Search in future) helps you discover more of this blog! :)
