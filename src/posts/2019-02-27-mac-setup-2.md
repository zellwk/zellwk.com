Setting up a new Mac is painful. Here are some of the things I have to do: 

1. Install all 47 applications I use every day. 
2. Provide the right credentials for each application. 
3. Change macOS default settings to the ones I like. 
4. Set up coding configurations. 
5. Move files from the old Mac to the new one. 

I estimate at least a three day's worth of work (downloading things and waiting for them to download 😴) if I have to install everything manually. 

But I was able to set my computer up in hours (automatically) thanks to dotfiles.

## What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles is a collective name for all files that begin with a dot. Examples include: 

- `.eslintrc`
- `.gitignore`
- `.editorconfig`

**To the programming community, dotfiles** are more than a name for files that begin with a dot. They **refer to startup scripts** that help you set up new computers. 

(I have no idea why programmers call startup scripts dotfiles. Maybe because dotfiles sound sexier? ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯). 

For clarity purposes, I'll use these terms: 

1. **Dotfiles**: files that begin with `.`. 
2. **Startup scripts**: scripts that help set up the computer. 

## What dotfiles do

A dotfile is used to configure how applications behave. For example: 

1. `.gitconfig` and `.gitignore` changes how `git` behaves. 
2. `.eslintrc` changes how ES Lint behaves.
3. `.editorconfig` changes how many text editors behave. 

These files live on your computer's `$HOME` directory. If you want to see what dotfiles you have, simply open up your Terminal app and type `ls -la`. You'll see a list of dotfiles. 

Here's what mine looks like now: 

<figure><img src="/images/2019/mac-setup/dotfiles.png" alt="Results from running ls -la in my $HOME directory"></figure>

Note: It's okay if you don't know what dotfiles are. They're not important for this article. I just *had* to explain the difference between dotfiles and startup scripts 😉. 

What's more interesting is the next part: Startup scripts. 

## My Startup script

If you get a new computer, you can run a startup script to: 

1. Download applications 
2. Change default settings

My [startup script][1] (aptly named: Dotfiles ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯) helps me install 31 out of the [47 applications][2] I use. This saves me a huge ton of work! 

It also helps me install commands that I use regularly on my command line. Examples include: `svgo` and `http-server`. (Note: These "commands" are generally called command line interfaces, or CLIs). 

The startup script does it through three files: 

1. `Brew.sh`
2. `npm.sh`
3. `.macos`

### Brew.sh

Brew is a shorthand for [Homebrew][3]. Homebrew lets you download packages onto macOS or Linux computers through the command line. 

It can help you install useful things like: 

1. Node 
2. PHP 
3. Git 
4. Openssh

It can also help you install applications. Here's a list of 31 applications I install with Homebrew. 

1. 1password
2. Alfred
3. Beamer
4. Dash
5. Dropbox
6. Firefox
7. Firefox Nightly
8. Chrome
9. Chrome Canary
10. Grammarly
11. Iterm2
12. Kap
13. Marked
14. Messenger
15. MongoDB Compass
16. Moom
17. Mplayerx
18. Notion
19. Obs
20. Odrive
21. Postman
22. Sketch
23. Skitch
24. Skype
25. Slack
26. Spotify
27. Telegram
28. Textexpander
29. Tower
30. Visual Studio Code
31. Wechat
32. Whatsapp

### npm.sh

[npm][4] lets you download JavaScript packages onto your computer. Many frontend development toolchains rely on npm. It comes installed with Node, and I installed Node with Brew. 

After running `brew.sh`, I configured my npm and install additional CLIs I use frequently. These include `http-server` and `svgo` that I mentioned above. 

### .macos

`.macos` helps you set up a new Mac with sensible default settings. 

Here, I copied Mathias Bynens `.macos` script and modified it to my personal preferences. You may want to refer to [his version][5] if you intend to build your own `.macos` file. 

## Symlinked dotfiles

(Note: This is an advanced section for people who use dotfiles). 

Earlier, I mentioned that dotfiles can be found in the `$HOME` folder. (Every Terminal app opens the `$HOME` folder by default). 

If you want to see what dotfiles you have, you can open your  Terminal app and type `ls -la`. You'll see a list of dotfiles. 

I also showed you what mine looks like: 

<figure><img src="/images/2019/mac-setup/dotfiles.png" alt="Results from running ls -la in my $HOME directory"></figure>

Notice the dotfiles in pink? These dotfiles also have a `->` to another file. The `->` indicates the dotfile in the `$HOME` folder is symlinked to the dotfile in my `dotfiles` project. 

### What is a symlink?

Symlink means symbolic link. It lets you open a file from a second location. 

Here's how it works: 

1. You decide on a source file 
2. You choose a second location (a destination) to open the file with. 
3. You run the symlink command. 
4. Once you run the symlink command, this destination file will point to the source file. 

In the case above, if I open `.gitconfig` from `$HOME`, I'm actually opening `.gitconfig` from `/Users/zellwk/project/dotfiles`. 

### Why create a symlink?

Dotfiles can change. I want to make sure my Dotfiles repo is updated with the latest changes. 

If I don't create symlinks, I'll forget to update my dotfiles project. (This has happened before with the dotfiles on my old computer 🤭). 

I created a `link.sh` file in the Dotfiles repo to help with creating symlinks. If I ever create a new dotfile in my Dotfiles repo, I just have to run `link.sh` to make sure everything is synced up properly 🤓. 

Finally, let's talk about the most important part: setting up my code editor. 

## Setting up my code editor

I'm anal when it comes things I use. Particularly things I use on a daily basis. I had to make sure my text editor is perfect to my own likings (and I spent days to configuring it... I don't want to do it again...). 

I use Visual Studio Code (VSCode from now on) as my text editor. It has a plugin that lets you sync everything you've configured onto another computer. The plugin is called [Settings Sync][6]. 

Here's how to set it up: 

First, create a personal [Github OAuth Token][7] according to the instructions on [Settings Sync][8].

On the old computer: 

1. Run the `Sync: Update / Upload Settings` command in VSCode.
2. It'll ask for authentication. 
3. Insert the OAuth Token you created into the box provided. 
4. Hit enter. 

Wait for \~10 seconds for the plugin to sync your settings into a Github Gist. Once it's done, you'll see the VS Code integrated shell. Scroll up and you'll see the OAuth token you used and the Gist ID the plugin stored your settings. 

<figure><img src="/images/2019/mac-setup/settings-sync.png" alt="Image of the Token and Gist after uploading VS Code settings"></figure>

SAVE THESE SOMEWHERE. YOU WILL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN. 

(No need to panic if you've lost them. Do the syncing process ☝️ again and you'll get new keys). 

On the new computer: 

1. Run the `Sync: Download settings` in VSCode
2. Fill in your Github OAuth token 
3. Fill in your Gist ID

Settings Sync will do its job and sync everything you've configured in VS Code. (Yes, this includes extensions too!). 

## Wrapping up

That's everything I could automate as I transitioned from my old Mac to the new one. I hope you found/learned something useful in this series!
