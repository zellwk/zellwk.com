**Zell does a really good job of simplifying complex subjects and structuring the learning in an organized way.**

This is the first course where I learned to differentiate which parts of JavaScript are important and which parts are not.

I used the knowledge I learned to create real components. It's very satisfying to see my code doing something of _real_ and _practical_ use.
