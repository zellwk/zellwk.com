**Zell has a way of explaining hard stuff that makes it easy for me to understand**.

I took part in an expensive boot camp and the experience was frustrating for me because they rush through so many topics without mastering them.

But Zell's courses are different. I appreciate the text format and the self-paced form of studying and the text format which gives me as much time as I need to make sure the knowledge sinks in.

**I've now regained my confidence and I know I have what it takes to be a great web developer.**
