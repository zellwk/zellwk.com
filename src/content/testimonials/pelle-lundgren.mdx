Learn JavaScript takes you through all the steps in building the components.

**The course doesn't stop after the first steps**. It shows you how to improve the component and include best practices. This is something I found so hard to learn from other courses.

**I finally started to understand how to move on from a beginner level to an intermediate level.**
