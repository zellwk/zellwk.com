I've tried lots of other JavaScript courses, both free and paid. **Learn JavaScript is the only course that helped me understand JavaScript.** It explained everything in depth and it gave me lots of examples.

**I can now think like a developer**, build applications myself, understand other developers' code, and even answer questions on StackOverflow.
