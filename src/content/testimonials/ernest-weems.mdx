I used countless other books and courses before, but they did not give me the applicable knowledge I needed to be a solid frontend developer.

Zell's courses are the only ones who gave me the knowledge.

{/* **Learn JavaScript is the only course that gave me that knowledge.** */}

**Now I can build pretty much whatever I want from scratch,** without relying on 3rd-party libraries.
