**This course gave me the confidence to call myself a front-end developer**. I know how to start, how to code it up, and how to search for (and understand) the parts that I don’t know yet.

**I went from knowing nothing about JavaScript to building a custom design system for my company entirely in JavaScript**. What’s more, each component I build is also accessible thanks to Zell’s accessibility lessons.
