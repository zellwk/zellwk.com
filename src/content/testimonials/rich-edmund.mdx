**I tried CodeSchool and TutsPlus before I joined Learn JavaScript, but they didn't help**. They were too advanced for me.

Learn JavaScript is a very well-taught course. Each lesson is clear and they build on the previous lesson. **I was able to understand the lessons in Learn JavaScript!**

Now, I can read and understand JavaScript. I don’t have to rely on Google for answers anymore. When I search on Google, I know what’s happening in each answer I find.
