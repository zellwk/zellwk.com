Thank you, Zell. You have put together one incredible resource.

**I love how everything you taught led up to projects that showed me how to use the principles of JavaScript**. Everything you taught laid an important foundation and then I immediately got to use it on practical projects.

**I know that every time I jump into the course I will learn something new, expand or deepen my javascript knowledge**, and become better and more marketable for jobs in the future.
