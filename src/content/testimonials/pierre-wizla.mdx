**What I loved about Zell's work is that they're really detailed but not overwhelming.** He guided me slowly, from basics to more advanced concepts, step by step, taking time to make sure I understood everything before going deeper.

**Thanks to Zell, I got a front-end web development job abroad**, in the wonderful city of Lausanne in Switzerland!
