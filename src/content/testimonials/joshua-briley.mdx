**Zell explains things in a way that no other instructor has been able to do in my 15+ years of trying to "self-educate"** in the world of Javascript.

He shows me how to use JavaScript theory to build real UI, then how to refactor my code with useful and modern techniques.

Thanks to the things I learned from the course, I have since refactored our style guide at work and I found the confidence to start a Vue project.
