There's a Cherokee saying about the tale of two wolves that goes like this:

{/* more */}

> One evening, an elderly Cherokee brave told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He said, ‘My son, the battle is between two wolves inside us all.
>
> One is evil. It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.
>
> The other wolf is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.’
>
> The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked, ‘Grandpa, which wolf wins?’
>
> The old Cherokee simply replied, ‘The one that you feed.’

Common wisdom tells you to feed the good wolf, because you will be good and you'll be able to do good.

But when you starve the bad wolf, it struggles and becomes even more ferocious. If the bad wolf can die, perhaps feeding the good wolf and starving the bad wolf is an excellent move.

But if the bad wolf doesn't die — because whenever there is light, there is darkness — who do you feed?

Before that, why do they fight?
