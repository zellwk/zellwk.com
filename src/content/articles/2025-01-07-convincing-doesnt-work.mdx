Trying to convince someone sets you up in an argument against them because convince ([etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/word/convince)) has the following roots:

- Vincere: to conquer
- weik: to fight/to conquer

When you fight to win someone, you'll either win or lose. No win-win situations can be created by fighting.

Look for alternatives to be on the same page so you can cooperate instead.
