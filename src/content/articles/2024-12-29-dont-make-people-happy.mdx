You'll encounter a couple of problems if you try to make people happy:

1. You begin pandering to their emotional whims. (This is problematic and is a road to misery).
2. If you overextend yourself, you'll want someone to pander to your emotional state as well. (Reciprocity and fairness, anyone?)
3. If nobody around you panders to you, you'll pander to yourself to balance the equation (good luck trying to avoid it).

**This creates a crazy "I'm not happy so you should make me happy" loop**. But this loop doesn't provide forward progress, so you won't get anything done in life (other than trying to find some relief from this insanity).

Plus, happiness is a fleeting state that cannot be maintained for long. People are filled with potential triggers that move them towards any emotion other than happy. So... good luck trying to keep anyone happy.

(Note: Trying to make someone not unhappy is on the same path as trying to make someone happy).

**What to do instead?**

Enjoy. In joy. injoy. (Credits to Panda Master Kelvin).

And now [here's a song for you](https://youtu.be/N_49uyhBIpI?si=2_KAdkPf7B0evYRW). (Yes, I see the irony. Ahha ahha).
