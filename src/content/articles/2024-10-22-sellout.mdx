It’s hard to resist that temptation — especially if you saw some initial results.

But selling out comes with a price far beyond any results they bring. The price is a destruction of trust.

Trust, once destroyed, can be incredibly hard to build again.

But not all hope is lost.

I have no facts to prove this, but a hunch tells me that everyone becomes a sellout at some point.

Perhaps it’s better to get this stage over and done with, then you’ll be able to plant you feet firmly back on the ground and do the work that what you’re meant to do all along.
