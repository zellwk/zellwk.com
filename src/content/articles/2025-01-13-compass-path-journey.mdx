Going to the place you want to go is often difficult but not impossible.

{/* more */}

It’s difficult because you have no idea how far the path is and how to find your way there. It’s difficult because you have no clear idea where the end is. You simply have a direction to run.

- And you keep running…
- And running…
- And running…

But without checkpoints…

- How would you know you’ve gotten there?
- How would you know you have not overshot?
- How would you know if you’re still running in the right direction?

At some point, you begin to be confused.

- What have you been doing?
- Where are your goals?
- Why is life still so… unhappy?

That’s because you’re lost.

You’re lost because you haven’t kept track of where you are going.

What now?

## Use Your Compass

You don’t have a map, but you have a compass. Now is the time to use that compass.

Let it show you which direction go.

- Then begin walking.
- See the sights.
- Notice where you are.
- Notice how have you been behaving.
- See how others are you behaving around you.

Keep walking.

Collect the data.

Explore.

At some point, you will begin to have enough data to plot a milestone for you.

Go for it — but make sure you keep your eyes open this time. Make sure you keep track of where you are going.

Once you hit that milestone, great. That’s your first checkpoint. Celebrate. Then, continue to let your compass guide you.

Repeat the steps.

- Plot another milestone.
- Go for it.
- And then a third.
- And a fourth.
- And on…
- And on…

Even if the road is endless,

- You know you can always turn your back and know where you have been.
- You know you can also let your compass guide you forward.
- You did not run mindlessly so you know where you are.
- You also know what to do next, step by step, bit by bit.

But what if you don’t hit the milestone?

Then use your compass again. Walk. Collect data. But make a smaller milestone this time, because your plotter might be faulty.

Then go for your milestone.

## Retracing vs New Path

Trust the compass.

If your compass points to the path you've walked before, you'll have to retrace your footsteps.

- Retrace it for as long as necessary.
- Don't fret.
- Follow your compass
- Keep your eyes open.

At some point, you'll stop retracing and begin moving towards your real goals. Then you will know where you've overshot and missed a turn.

If you don't need to retrace your steps, that's alright too.

Trust the compass.

- Let it guide you.
- Walk.
- Keep your eyes open.
- Trace your steps if you need to.
- Collect data.
- Plot.
- Then go.
- Then repeat the steps once again.

The path you've been on and the path you're going to walk now on — they're both part of your journey. Nothing is wasted.

So keep walking, Johnnie walker.
