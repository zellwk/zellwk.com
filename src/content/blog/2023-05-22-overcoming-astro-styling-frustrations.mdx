After using Astro for a while, I came to realize that Astro's biggest features — islands and slots — both delight and frustrate me.

Most people already know what the delights are, so I won't bother writing about them in this article. I'll focus on what frustrates me and how I resolve those frustrations.

First, we need to talk about when Astro creates islands and slots.

## When Astro creates islands and slots

Astro creates an `astro-island` tag, along with `style` and `script` tags when you include a component with client directives.

```astro
---
import Component from './components/Component.svelte'
---

<Component client:load />
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/astro-island.png' />

If the component (with client directives) contains a `slot`, Astro will create an `astro-slot` tag. This `astro-slot` will be found within an `astro-island`.

```astro
---
import Component from './components/Component.svelte'
---

<Component client:load>
  <div>Some Slotted Content</div>
</Component>
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/astro-slots.png' />

Now, if you include a component without client directives, Astro will not create `astro-island` and `astro-slot` tags.

```astro
---
import Component from './components/Component.svelte'
---

<Component>
  <div>Some Slotted Content</div>
</Component>
```

## What's frustrating about Astro islands and slots

Since Astro only creates these tags when you include client directives, styling components can become unpredictable — because some components will have client directives while others won't.

Problems arise when the DOM contains `astro-island` and `astro-slots`. That's because these tags change the document flow, so you cannot pretend that they don't exist.

To be more specific, I noticed four extremely frustrating things when `astro-island` and `astro-slot` are present in the DOM.

1. Direct descendant selectors no longer work
2. Lobotomized owls no longer work
3. CSS Grid positioning no longer works
4. Nth-child no longer works

I'm going to talk about each one in turn, and how to resolve these frustrations.

## Direct descendant selectors no longer work

Direct descendant selectors no longer work when `astro-island` and `astro-slot` is in the DOM.

This makes sense because the DOM has changed, so direct descendant selectors no longer target the element you wish to target.

Imagine you want to have this HTML

```html
<div class="Component">
  <div>Some Content</div>
</div>
```

But Astro creates this HTML because it has slots.

```html
<div class="Component">
  <astro-slot>
    <div>Some Content</div>
  </astro-slot>
</div>
```

If you wrote a direct descendant selector, that selector wouldn't work. That's because the direct descendant selector now targets the `astro-slot` level children instead of the one you are aiming for.

```css
/* No longer works */
.Component > div {
  /* Styles here */
}
```

### Fixing it

**Fixing direct descendant selectors with slots is simple — all you have to do is add `astro-slot` in the selector chain.**

```css
/* Works */
.Component > astro-slot > div {
  /* Styles here */
}
```

<Callout type="note">

The above code snippets assume you're writing global CSS. If you're using CSS Scoped to the component, you'll have to write the following instead since we're dealing with slots.

```css
/* Scoped CSS*/
.Component :global(> astro-slot > div) {
  /* Styles here */
}
```

</Callout>

**Another alternative is simply to use descend selectors instead of direct descendant selectors** if the HTML structure allows for it.

```css
/* Works */
.Component div {
  /* Styles here */
}
```

Let's move on.

## Lobotomized owls no longer work

Lobotomized owl is a way to style things with the sibling universal selectors. [It was first coined by Heydon Pickering](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/) in 2014.

```css
/* Lobotomized owl selector */
* + * {
  /* Your styles here */
}
```

The lobotomized owl selector can be used to style children elements easily — giving them margins, paddings, and other properties as necessary.

Here's an example that I commonly use to give some space between elements.

```css
.Parent > * + * {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

Unfortunately, these styles won't work on `astro-island` and `astro-slot` tags because they use the [`display: content` property](https://bitsofco.de/how-display-contents-works/).

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/lobotomized-owl-not-working.png' />

### Fixing it

Elements with `display: contents` will have their styles ignored, so any styles added to these elements will be ignored.

**The easy way to fix this is to add the styles to the elements contained in `astro-island` or `astro-slot`.**

Here's what the CSS looks like.

```css
.Parent > * + *,
.Parent > * + :where(astro-island, astro-slot) > *:first-child {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/lobotomized-owl-working.png' />

## CSS Grid Positioning no longer works

This one is similar to the lobotomized owl one — because Astro islands and slots use `display: contents`, no styles will work on them.

These styles include `grid-column`, `grid-row`. So you will not be able to change the Conponent's positioning with `grid-column`.

Here's an example where we laid all items out in a two-column grid. In this example, trying to use set `grid-column` on the `astro-island` and `astro-slots` will not work.

```astro
---
import Component from './Component.svelte'
---

<div class='Grid'>
  <Component client:load />
  <Component client:load />
  <Component client:load />
</div>

<style>
  .Grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    gap: 1em;
  }

  /* Tries to make all grid items span the full width */
  .Grid > * {
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
  }
</style>
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/grid.png' />

There are two ways to fix this problem.

### Fixing it

**The first way is to bypass `astro-island` and `astro-slot` with the technique mentioned abov**e.

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 1em;
}

/* Tries to make all grid items span the full width */
.grid > *,
.grid > :where(astro-island, astro-slot) > *:first-child {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
}
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/grid-fixed.png' />

**The second way is to put the components in another element.**

```html
<div class="Grid">
  <div><Component client:load /></div>
  <div><Component client:load /></div>
  <div><Component client:load /></div>
</div>
```

```css
.Grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 1em;
}

.Grid > * {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
}
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/grid-fixed.png' />

## Nth-child no longer works as expected

When Astro adds `astro-island` to the DOM, they also add `style `and `script` tags to the DOM at the same time.

Since `style` and `script` tags are also considered children elements, you cannot depend on the `nth-child` selector to target the right element anymore.

Using the same code examples from above, let's say we have the following HTML.

```html
<div class="Grid">
  <Component client:load></Component>
  <Component client:load></Component>
  <Component client:load></Component>
</div>
```

This produces a DOM that looks like this.

- First element is a `style` tag
- Second element is a `script` tag
- Next three elements are `astro-island` tags

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/astro-components.png' />

<Callout type='note'>
  Astro will only include `style` and `script` tags for the components once in
  the DOM. This is why you see only one `style ` tag and one `script` instead of
  3 `style` tags and 3 `script` tags.
</Callout>

If you want to get the first component with `nth-child`, you need to pass in `nth-child(3)` instead of `nth-child(1)`. That's because the first component is now the third element in the DOM tree.

```css
/* Style the first component, but it's the third child */
.Grid > *:nth-child(3) > .Component {
  background-color: red;
}
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/component-red.png' />

Yes, I know it's confusing.

There are two ways to fix this confusing problem

### Fixing it

**The first way is to wrap the components with another element.**

You can then use `nth-child` to style with a descendant selector to style the component.

```html
<div class="Grid">
  <div><Component client:load /></div>
  <div><Component client:load /></div>
  <div><Component client:load /></div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Tries to make all grid items span the full width */
.Grid > *:first-child .Component {
  background-color: red;
}
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/component-red.png' />

**The second way is to stop using `nth-child` and use `nth-of-type` instead.**

```css
.Grid > astro-island:nth-of-type(1) > .Component {
  background-color: red;
}
```

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/component-red.png' />

## A deeper layer of frustrations

Things get a little bit more confusing if you need to pass a component into a slot — especially if both components (the parent one and the one in the slot) need JavaScript functionality.

```astro
---
import Component from './components/Component.svelte'
import Nested from './components/Nested.svelte'
---

<Component client:load>
  <Nested client:load />
</Component>
```

Astro will create the following layout:

1. `astro-island` in the top level
2. `astro-slot` in the second level (since `Component` gets content through a slot)
3. Another `astro-island` after `astro-slot` since `Nested` needs to have JavaScript functionality as well.

<Image src='/src/assets/blog/astro-styling-frustrations/nested-island-and-slots.png' />

I'm not sure whether this level of complexity is necessary though.

Most of the time, I just one layer of `astro-island` and a layer of `astro-slot`. So this should be an edge case more than anything else.

## Wrapping up

I've just shared with you when and how Astro creates `astro-island` and `astro-slot`.

I've also shared with you how to overcome the styling frustrations that happen when `astro-island` and `astro-slot` elements are present in the DOM.

With this, you should now be able to use Astro effectively without encountering further styling issues.
