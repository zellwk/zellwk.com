"Now" is grossly inaccurate because `zlFetch` has supported Form Data since v5.0 (since April) and weâ€™re already at v6.0 ðŸ™ƒ.

{/* more */}

Nevertheless, let me share with you what this is all about.

## How `zlFetch` supports Form Data

You can now pass Form Data content into [`zlFetch`](https://github.com/zellwk/zl-fetch) and it will correctly send a `multipart/form-data` encoding to the server.

```js
form.addEventListener('submit', async event => {
  const data = new FormData(form)

  const response = await zlFetch('some-url', {
    body: data,
  })
})
```

This is similar to the rest of our API where `zlFetch` automatically helps you set the `Content-Type` header:

- If you pass in an object, it converts the data into JSON and sends an `application/json` content type.
- If you pass in a string, it uses the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

## Problems with Form Data

Iâ€™m not a fan of using Form Data because of two reasons:

1. The backend needs to support it
2. You canâ€™t tell whatâ€™s inside a Form Data easily

### The backend needs to support it

Form Data is more complicated than `json` or `x-www-form-urlencoded` data because it can be sent in multiple parts.

In express, you can support Form Data by adding the `multer` package.

```js
import multer from 'multer'
const upload = multer()

// Then use upload middleware when you need it.
app.post('/some-url', upload.none(), (req, res) => {
  // req.body contains the data
})
```

Most of the time, I prefer to send JSON since there's no need to use `multer` and mess with `multipart/form-data`.

### Itâ€™s harder to debug Form Data

You canâ€™t see whatâ€™s inside a Form Data easily. If you want to see the contents, you have to loop through the form data and log each entry.

```js
const data = new FormData(form)
for (const key, value of data) {
	console.log(key, value)
}
```

This is way too complex for my liking. I prefer to use an Object and see everything at once.

## Converting Form Data into an object

Because I like working with objects more than Form Data, I included a utility in `zlFetch` that lets you convert Form Data into an object.

With this, you no longer need to extract each form element individually. Just use the utility and itâ€™ll handle the data for you.

```js
import zlFetch, { toObject } from 'zl-fetch'

form.addEventListener('submit', async event => {
  const formData = new FormData(form)
  const data = toObject(formData)

  console.log(data)
})
```

<Image src="/assets/blog/zl-fetch-form-data/logging-to-object.png" />

You can then send this data as JSON over to the server like this:

```js
import zlFetch, { toObject } from 'zl-fetch'

form.addEventListener('submit', async event => {
  const formData = new FormData(form)
  const data = toObject(formData)

  const response = await zlFetch('some-url', {
    body: data,
  })
})
```

I also added this utility into [Splendid UI](https://splendidlabz.com) ðŸ™ƒ. So you can tell that Iâ€™m putting lots of helpful things into Splendid UI as I go along.

Itâ€™s gonna be one of the best component libraries around. Iâ€™ll share more about Splendid in another post.

Speaking about utilities, I've created another utility to it easy to send `form-urlencoded` data.

## Utility for form-urlencoded data

`zlFetch` contains a `toQueryString` utility that can convert an object into a query string.

This makes it easy to send `x-www-form-urlencoded` data.

```js
import { toQueryString } from 'zl-fetch'

zlFetch.post('some-url', {
  body: toQueryString({ message: 'Good game' }),
})
```

Behind the scenes, this is a simple utility since we're just passing the object through `URLSearchParams` ðŸ™ƒ. But hey, it's good to have this utility since it makes things a little bit simpler than before!

```js
export function toQueryString(object) {
  const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(object)
  return searchParams.toString()
}
```

That's it for today!
