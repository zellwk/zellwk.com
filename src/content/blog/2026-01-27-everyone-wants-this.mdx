I was feeling rather depressed earlier. 

My negative thoughts were racing: "People won't like this". "Nobody is going to buy". "There are not enough users". "They're going to find you irritating for trying to sell". "Why waste your time and energy", etc. 

It was a downward spiral. 

What brightened me up was a passage by Benjamin Zander from "[The Art Of Possibility](https://www.amazon.sg/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/0142001104)", which says somewhat the following:  

- The music profession says: 3% of the population likes classical music. If only we could move it to 4%, our problems would be over. 
- Ben says: Everyone loves classical music. They just haven’t found out about it yet! 
- **How would you walk, talk, and who would you be,** if you think everybody likes classical music?

I found a YouTube video where Benjamin said this live if you wanna hear from the horse's mouth. (I recommend watching the whole video, but this short little snippet will suffice for this piece).

## Everyone loves this? 

Maybe it's a stretch to say "Everybody loves this!" for the products I make, but it won't be too far of a stretch to believe that **"web developers like my work. They just haven't found out about it yet"**. 

After all, I know I'm doing good work. 

Then my job becomes easier. 

I no longer have to carry the cynical depressive weight that I've been carrying around. I don't have to fight the negatives anymore. 

**The only things I need to do are**: 

1. Show up in front of more people (more times)
2. Show them how my stuff can help them 
3. Bridge the gap between the story they wanna hear and the work I'm doing

It's still not easy. 

I got work to do.
