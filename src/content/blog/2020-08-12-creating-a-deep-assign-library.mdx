I created a [library][1] to merge objects last week. It's called `mix`. `mix` lets you perform a deep merge between two objects.

The difference between `mix` and other deep merging libraries is: `mix` lets you copy accessors while others don't.

[You can find out more about `mix` in last week's article.][2]

I thought it'll be fun to share the process (and pains) while building the library. So here it is.

{/* more */}

## It started with solving a problem I had

I started playing with accessor functions recently. One day, I noticed accessors don't work when they're copied via `Object.assign`. Since I wanted to copy accessors, `Object.assign` didn't work for me anymore.

I need another method.

I did some research and discovered I can create an `Object.assign` clone that supports the copying of accessors quite easily.

```js
// First version, shallow merge.
function mix (...sources) {
  const result = {}
  for (const source of sources) {
    const props = Object.keys(source)
    for (const prop of props) {
      const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(source, prop)
      Object.defineProperty(result, prop, descriptor)
    }
  }
  return result
}
```

I explained the creation process for this simple `mix` function in [my previous article][3], so I won't say the same thing again today. Go read that one if you're interested to find out more.

This simple `mix` function was okay. But it wasn't enough.

I wanted a way to make merge objects without worrying about mutation since [mutation can be a source of hard-to-find bugs][4]. This meant I needed a way to recursively clone objects.

## Researching other libraries

First, I searched online to see if anyone created a library I needed. I found several options that copied objects, but none of them allowed copying of accessors.

So I had to make something.

In the process, I discovered I can use a combination of Lodash's `assign` and `deepClone` functions to achieve what I want easily.

Update: Mitch Neverhood shared that Lodash has a `merge` function that was deep. If we wanted an immutable merge, we could do this:

```js
import { cloneDeep, merge } from 'lodash';
export const immutableMerge = (a, b) => merge(cloneDeep(a), b);
```

But Lodash was too heavy for me. I don't want to include such a big library in my projects. I wanted something light and without dependencies.

So I made a library.

## A journey into deep cloning objects

When I started, I thought it's easy to create deep clones of an object. All I had to do was

1. Loop through properties of an object
2. If the property is an object, create a new object

Cloning object properties (even for accessors) are simple enough. I can replace the property's descriptor value with a new object via Object spread.

```js
const object = { /* ... */ }
const copy = {}
const props = Object.keys(object)

for (const prop of props) {
  const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, prop)
  const value = descriptor.value
  if (value) descriptor.value = { ...value }
  Object.defineProperty(copy, prop, descriptor)
}
```

This wasn't enough because Object spread creates a shallow clone.

I needed recursion. So I created a function to clone objects. I call it `cloneDescriptorValue` (because I was, in fact, cloning the descriptor's value).

```js
// Creates a deep clone for each value
function cloneDescriptorValue (value) {
  if (typeof value === 'object) {
    const props = Object.keys(value)
    for (const prop of props) {
      const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(value, prop)
      if (descriptor.value) descriptor.value = cloneDescriptorValue(descriptor.value)
      Object.defineProperty(obj, prop, descriptor)
    }
    return obj
  }

  // For values that don't need cloning, like primitives for example
  return value
}
```

I used `cloneDescriptorValue` like this:

```js
const object = { /* ... */ }
const copy = {}
const props = Object.keys(object)

for (const prop of props) {
  const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, prop)
  const value = descriptor.value
  if (value) descriptor.value = cloneDescriptorValue(value)
  Object.defineProperty(copy, prop, descriptor)
}
```

This clones objects (including accessors) recursively.

But we're not done.

### Cloning arrays

Although Arrays are objects, they're special. I cannot treat them like normal objects. So I had to devise a new way.

First, I needed to differentiate between Arrays and Objects. JavaScript has an `isArray` method that does this.

```js
// Creates a deep clone for each value
function cloneDescriptorValue (value) {
  if (Array.isArray(value)) {
    // Handle arrays
  }

  if (typeof value === 'object) {
    // Handle objects
  }

  // For values that don't need cloning, like primitives for example
  return value
}
```

Arrays can contain any kind of value. If the array contained another array, I must clone the nested array. I did this by running every value through `cloneDescriptorValue` again.

This takes care of recursion.

```js
// Creates a deep clone for each value
function cloneDescriptorValue (value) {
  if (Array.isArray(value)) {
    const array = []
    for (let v of value) {
      v = cloneDescriptorValue(v)
      array.push(v)
    }
    return array
  }

  // ...
}
```

I thought I was done. But I wasn't 😢.

### Cloning functions...?

The next day, I wondered if it's possible to clone functions. We don't want functions to mutate either, don't we?

I wasn't sure whether I should do this. I wasn't sure whether it was possible to clone functions too.

A google search brought me to [this deep-cloning article][5] where I was reminded about other Object types like `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, and `RegExp`. (More work to do). It also talked about Circular references (which I did not handle in my library).

I forgot all about cloning functions at this point. I went into the rabbit hole and tried to find ways to deep clone objects without writing each type of object individually. (I'm lazy).

While searching, I discovered a thing known as the [Structured Clone Algorithm][6]. This sounds good. It's exactly what I wanted! But even though the algorithm exists, there's no way to actually use it. I couldn't find its source anywhere.

Then, I chanced upon [Das Surma's journey into deep-copying][7] which talks about the Structured Clone Algorithm and how to use it. Surma explained we can use this Structured Clone Algorithm via three methods:

1. MessageChannel API
2. History API
3. Notification API

All three API exist in browsers only. I wanted my utility to work both in Browsers and in Node. I couldn't use any of these methods. I had to look for something else.

The next day, I thought of Lodash. So I did a quick search. Lodash didn't have a deep merge method. But I could clobber something together with `_.assign` and `_.cloneDeep` if I wanted.

In its documentations, Lodash explained `_.cloneDeep` (which recursively uses `_.clone`) was loosely based on the Structured Clone Algorithm. I was intrigued and dove into the source code.

<Image src="/images/2020/create-deep-assign-library/lodash.png" alt="" />

Long story short, I wasn't able to use Lodash's source code directly since it was such a complicated library. But I managed to find a piece of gem that looked like this:

```js
var argsTag = '[object Arguments]',
    arrayTag = '[object Array]',
    boolTag = '[object Boolean]',
    dateTag = '[object Date]',
    errorTag = '[object Error]',
    funcTag = '[object Function]',
    genTag = '[object GeneratorFunction]',
    mapTag = '[object Map]',
    numberTag = '[object Number]',
    objectTag = '[object Object]',
    regexpTag = '[object RegExp]',
    setTag = '[object Set]',
    stringTag = '[object String]',
    symbolTag = '[object Symbol]',
    weakMapTag = '[object WeakMap]';

var arrayBufferTag = '[object ArrayBuffer]',
    dataViewTag = '[object DataView]',
    float32Tag = '[object Float32Array]',
    float64Tag = '[object Float64Array]',
    int8Tag = '[object Int8Array]',
    int16Tag = '[object Int16Array]',
    int32Tag = '[object Int32Array]',
    uint8Tag = '[object Uint8Array]',
    uint8ClampedTag = '[object Uint8ClampedArray]',
    uint16Tag = '[object Uint16Array]',
    uint32Tag = '[object Uint32Array]';

/** Used to identify `toStringTag` values supported by `_.clone`. */
var cloneableTags = {};
cloneableTags[argsTag] = cloneableTags[arrayTag] =
cloneableTags[arrayBufferTag] = cloneableTags[dataViewTag] =
cloneableTags[boolTag] = cloneableTags[dateTag] =
cloneableTags[float32Tag] = cloneableTags[float64Tag] =
cloneableTags[int8Tag] = cloneableTags[int16Tag] =
cloneableTags[int32Tag] = cloneableTags[mapTag] =
cloneableTags[numberTag] = cloneableTags[objectTag] =
cloneableTags[regexpTag] = cloneableTags[setTag] =
cloneableTags[stringTag] = cloneableTags[symbolTag] =
cloneableTags[uint8Tag] = cloneableTags[uint8ClampedTag] =
cloneableTags[uint16Tag] = cloneableTags[uint32Tag] = true;
cloneableTags[errorTag] = cloneableTags[funcTag] =
cloneableTags[weakMapTag] = false;
```

This piece tells me two things:

1. How to determine different types of objects like (RegExp, Map, Set, etc).
2. What objects are clone-able, and what objects aren't.

I can see that functions cannot be cloned, which makes sense, so I stopped trying to clone functions.

```js
// Part that tells me functions cannot be cloned
cloneableTags[errorTag] = cloneableTags[funcTag] =
cloneableTags[weakMapTag] = false;
```

## Cloning other types of objects

The problem remains: I still need to recursively create clones for other types of objects. I started by refactoring my code to detect other object types.

```js
function cloneDescriptorValue (value) {
  if (objectType(value) === '[object Array]') {
    // Handle Arrays
  }

  if (objectType(value) === '[object Object]') {
    // Handle pure objects
  }

  // Other values that don't require cloning
  return
}

function objectType (value) {
  return Object.prototype.toString.call(value)
}
```

Then I started working on the simplest object type: Dates.

### Cloning Dates

Dates are simple. I can create a new `Date` value that contains the same timestamp as the original Date.

```js
function cloneDescriptorValue (value) {
  // Handle Arrays and Objects

  if (objectType(value) === '[object Date]') {
    return new Date(value.getTime())
  }

  // ...
}
```

I tackled Maps next.

### Deep Cloning Map

`Map` is like `Object` with a few differences.

One of them is: You can use objects as keys. If you used an object as a key, you won't be able to retrieve the key's values if I created a new object.

So I opt to create clones only for map values.

```js
function cloneDescriptorValue (value) {
  // ...
  if (objectType(value) === '[object Map]') {
    const map = new Map()
    for (const entry of value) {
      map.set(entry[0], cloneDescriptorValue(entry[1]))
    }
    return map
  }
  // ...
}
```

I didn't clone WeakMaps because we cannot iterate through WeakMaps. It's was technically impossible to create a clone.

### Deep Cloning Set

Sets are like arrays, but they contain unique values only. I decided to create a new reference for values in Sets because Lodash does it as well.

```js
function cloneDescriptorValue (value) {
  // ...
  if (objectType(value) === '[object Set]') {
    const set = new Set()
    for (const entry of value.entries()) {
      set.add(cloneDescriptorValue(entry[0]))
    }
    return set
  }
  // ...
}
```

### More types...

I decided to stop working on other types because I don't use them at all. I didn't want to write extra code that I won't use (especially if no one else uses the library)

## Tests

Of course, with any library creation, it's important to write tests to ensure the library functions correctly. I wrote a couple of them while creating this project. 😎

## Update: Preventing Prototype Pollution

Kyle Wilson asked how I was preventing Prototype Pollution. I had complete no idea what he was talked about, so I did a search.

Turns out, Prototype Pollution was a serious issue that used to be present in jQuery and Lodash. It may still be present in many libraries today! You can read more about it [here](https://medium.com/node-modules/what-is-prototype-pollution-and-why-is-it-such-a-big-deal-2dd8d89a93c).

Without going into too much details, I just want to let you know I [fixed this issue](https://github.com/zellwk/javascript/releases/tag/v1.0.1).

## Final mix function

That's it! [Here's the final `mix` function I created][8].

I hope this article gives you an experience of the roller coaster ride when I experienced when creating the library. It's not easy to create a library. I deeply appreciate people out there who have done the work and shared it with others.
