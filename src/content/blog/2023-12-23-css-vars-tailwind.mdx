Today I discovered that you can change CSS Variables with Tailwind on the fly.

{/* more */}

Here's the syntax:

```html
<div class="[--span:2] md:[--span:3]">...</div>
```

This is _very_ powerful — because it gives me the ability to change the number of columns in a custom grid easily with CSS Variables like `--span`.

And as you may suspect, I'm integrating this methodology with the layouts I'm creating in [CSS Layout Patterns](https://magicaldevschool.com/css-layout-patterns/).

One of my latest inventions is a [Masonry Grid](https://twitter.com/zellwk/status/1737880790787305835) that can span multiple columns — with super little CSS and JavaScript.

Honestly, I'm seeing CSS Layout Patterns as the easiest way to create layouts now. Can't wait to share more about it in the future.
