There are two ways to enhance Markdown in an Astro project. 

1. [Through MDX](/blog/markdown-astro/)
2. Through a Markdown Component

This article focuses on the Markdown Component. 

## Why Use A Markdown Component

I use a Markdown Component for two main reasons: 

1. It reduces the amount of markup I need to write 
2. It converts typographic symbols like \' to opening or closing quotes. 

So I can skip several HTML tags — like `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, and `<a>`. I can also skip heading tags if I don't need to add classes to them. 

```html
<div class="card">
  <!-- prettier-ignore --> 
  <Markdown>
    ## Card Title 
    
    This is a paragraph with **strong** and *italic* text.
    
    This is the second paragraph with a [link](https://link-somewhere.com)
    
    - List
    - Of
    - Items
  </Markdown>
</div>
```

Notice the `prettier-ignore` comment? It tells prettier not to format the contents within the `<Markdown>` block, so Prettier won't mess up my Markdown content. 

The HTML output will be as follows: 

```html
<div class="card">
	<h2> Card Title </h2>

	<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>strong</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.</p>
    
	<p>
		This is the second paragraph with a 
		<a href="https://link-somewhere.com">link</a>
	</p>
    
	<ul>
    <li> List </li>
    <li> Of </li>
    <li> Items </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## Installing the Markdown Component 

Fun Fact: Astro came with a `<Markdown>` component in its early release, but this `<Markdown>` component was [migrated to a separate plugin in v1](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v1/#markdown--component-removed), and [completely removed in v3](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v3/#removed-markdown--component). 

I was upset about it. But I decided to build a Markdown component for myself since I liked using one. You can view the [documentation here](https://splendidlabz.com/docs/astro/components/markdown/#features). 

**Using the Markdown component is simple**: Just import and use it in the way I showed you above. 

```astro
---
import { Markdown } from '@splendidlabz/astro'
---

<Markdown> ... </Markdown>
```

### Inline Option 

There's an `inline` option that tells the `<Markdown>` component not to generate paragraph tags. 

```astro
<h2 class="max-w-[12em]">
  <Markdown inline> Ain't this cool? </Markdown>
</h2>
```

Here's the output: 

```astro
<h2 class="max-w-[12em]">
  Ain't this cool?
</h2>
```

## Gotchas and Caveats 

Prettier messes up the `<!-- prettier-ignore -->` block if you have unicode characters like emojis and emdashes anywhere before the block. 

```astro title="Before saving"
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Markdown>
  Markdown block that contains unicode characters 🤗
</Markdown>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Markdown>
  Second Markdown block.
</Markdown>
```

```diff lang="markdown" title="After saving"
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Markdown>
  Markdown block that contains unicode characters 🤗
</Markdown>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<arkdown>
  Second Markdown block.
</
```

Unfortunately, we can't do much about emojis because the issue stems from Prettier's formatter.

But, we can use `en` and `em` dashes by writing `--` and `---` respectively.
