I silently updated `zlFetch` a couple of months ago with some improvements that make coding much easier — especially if you're using `zlFetch` in Node.

## What is zlFetch?

Just in case you don't know about it, [zlFetch](https://github.com/zellwk/zl-fetch) is a wrapper over the native Fetch API. I've built `zlFetch` because I wanted to make it easier to use the Fetch API.

Now without further ado, let me talk about the quality of life improvements I've made recently.

## Returning errors

`zlFetch` was built to catch and throw HTTP errors, so `zlFetch` is promise-friendly.

```js
zlFetch('some-url')
  .then(/* do something when successful */)
  .catch(/* throw an error when unsuccessful */)
```

Although this pattern follows the promise spec, it can be very unwieldy when used in an `async` function. Typically, if you want to handle an error, you have to use a `try/catch`pattern.

```js
try {
  const response = await zlFetch('some-url')
  // Do something with the response
} catch (error) {
  // Do something with the error
}
```

I didn't like this so I added a `returnError` property to `zlFetch`. This allows you to return the error message instead of throwing it.

Then you can use a standard `if/else` conditionals to write your Fetch requests.

```js
const { response, error } = await zlFetch('some-url', {
  returnError: true
})

if (response) // Do something with response
if (error) // Do something with error
```

You can make it even easier by [creating an instance of zlFetch](#creating-a-zlfetch-instance) with the options you want to use. More on this later.

## Debug Mode

`zlFetch` now contains a `debug` mode.

This lets you know exactly what you're sending in your request — so you don't have to check the Network Panel to know what you sent over.

Just add the `debug` mode and you can log what you're sending over.

```js
const { response, debug } = await zlFetch(
  'https://api.github.com/users/zellwk/repos',
  {
    query: { per_page: 100 },
    debug: true,
  }
)

console.log(debug)
```

## Creating a zlFetch Instance

It's now possible to create a `zlFetch` instance that contains the options you wish to use.

You can attach a base URL you wish to use over a couple of APIs...

```js
import { createZlFetch } from 'zl-fetch'

// Create the instance
const api = createZlFetch('https://your-api.com/api/v1')

// Using the instance
const response = await api.post('users', {
  body: {
    firstName: 'Zell',
    lastName: 'Liew',
    email: 'helloworld@gmail.com',
  },
})
```

...attach options you typically use...

```js
import { createZlFetch } from 'zl-fetch'

// Create the instance
const api = createZlFetch({ returnError: true })

// Using the instance
const { response, error } = await api.post(/* ... */)
```

... or both!

```js
import { createZlFetch } from 'zl-fetch'

// Create the instance
const api = createZlFetch('https://your-api.com/api/v1', {
  returnError: true,
})

// Using the instance
const { response, error } = await api.post('users', {
  body: {
    firstName: 'Zell',
    lastName: 'Liew',
    email: 'helloworld@gmail.com',
  },
})
```

This feature helps a lot when you have to send many fetch requests in the same file.

One great example is if you create a file to house all requests to a particular API.

Another great example is when you have to send many requests when you test your APIs. (I cover this in more detail in my [Node Workshop](https://magicaldevschool.com/workshops)).

## Removing node-fetch as a dependency.

We have removed the `node-fetch` dependency in `v6.0.0` since Node `v17` contains the Fetch API.

You will still be able to use `zlFetch` as normal — nothing will change — if you're using Node `v17` and above.

If you're using a legacy version of Node, we'll need you to import `node-fetch` into your project before using `zlFetch`.

## That's it for today!

There are a few more qualify of life improvements that I've made, but I think this is big enough of an announcement today.

I'll talk about other features in another newsletter to come.
