SVG is one of the most important elements in a website or web application because it provides us with scalable graphics.

They are usually used for two things:

1. Icons from icon sets
2. Custom graphics

Today I'm going to show you how the [SVG](https://splendid-ui.com/svelte/svg) utility from [Splendid UI](https://splendid-ui.com) works, and why it's the easiest way to use SVG to load both icons and custom graphics.

## Installing the SVG Utility

First, you need to install Splendid UI.

```shell
npm install splendid-ui —save
```

Then you import the SVG component from `splendid-ui/svelte`

```svelte
<script>
  import { SVG } from 'splendid-ui/svelte'
</script>
```

Since this `SVG` is a Svelte component, it can be used for both Astro and Svelte projects.

## Loading an icon set with the SVG component

The `SVG` component uses [Iconify](https://iconify.design) to load icons. This lets you load icons from popular icon sets just by naming the icon set and the icon name.

Here are some examples:

- `tabler:menu` - Menu icon from Tabler
- `material-symbols:menu` - Menu icon from Material Symbols
- `zondicons:menu` - Menu icon from Zondicons

```astro
<SVG icon="tabler:menu" /> Tabler's Menu
<SVG icon="material-symbols:menu" /> Material Symbol's menu
<SVG icon="zondicons:menu" /> Zondicon's menu
```

import Simple from '/src/examples/svg/simple.svelte'

<Simple client:load />

### Loading icons in Svelte

You can load the icons with the following code in Svelte:

```svelte
<script>
  import { SVG } from 'splendid-ui/svelte'
</script>

<SVG icon="icon-set:icon-name" />
```

### Loading icons in Astro

If you're using Astro, you must add a `client:load` directive or the icons won't be loaded.

```astro
---
import { SVG } from 'splendid-ui/svelte'
---

<SVG icon="icon-set:icon-name" client:load />
```

We need a `client` directive when using Astro because Iconify saves icons in localStorage, which means icons will not be loaded on the server.

Unfortunately, this means you'll see a flicker of invisible icons for a bit when the page is loaded for the first time. (On subsequent loads, the process is so quick you'll never even notice it).

/>

As you can see from the video above, the time taken to load the SVG icon is negligible. After seeing this, I felt that attempts to remove this tiny delay would be considered over-engineering.

That's why I'm happy to release the SVG component as it is today.

### Finding icon sets and names

You can view all supported icon sets and their respective icons through [Iconify's icon browser](https://icon-sets.iconify.design), the [Figma component](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/iconify) or [Icones](https://icones.js.org).

## Loading a custom SVG from your project files

This `SVG` component also supports loading custom SVGs from your project files.

To use this, you need to make sure you have two conditions fulfilled:

1. There is an `svg` folder in your `src` directory.
2. You have added your SVG into this folder.

When both conditions are fulfilled, you can pass the name of this SVG file into `icon` and the `SVG` component will do the rest.

If you use Astro, there's no need to use the `client:load` directive in this case because `SVG` will create the necessary SVG element in the HTML right away.

For example, if you have an SVG that is called `logo.svg`, you only need to pass `logo` into `icon`.

```astro
---
import { SVG } from 'splendid-ui/svelte'
---

<SVG icon="logo" />
```

That's it!

## Wrapping Up

I created this `SVG` component to make it easier for me to load icons when I'm building Astro and Svelte apps.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

And if you do, please consider checking out [Splendid UI](https://splendid-ui.com) and spreading the word about it. Thank you.
