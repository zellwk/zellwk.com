Couple of years ago (I forgot exactly when), I removed the dates that were preceeding the file names of my blog articles.

{/* more */}

That's was probably one of the greatest mistakes I've made.

It took away the desire to write — and replaced it with an overwhelm instead.

Today, I'm putting the dates back in.

Hopefully this marks a new beginning — a new chapter — and a different kind of writing you'll see from me.
