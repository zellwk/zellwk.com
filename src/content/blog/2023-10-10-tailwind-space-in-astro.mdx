title: Splendid Astro Spacing â€” A Tailwind Utility for Astro

When using Tailwind with Astro, youâ€™ll notice that [Tailwindâ€™s space utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/space) stop working when you use it with Astro Components or Slots .

{/* more */}

```astro
<!-- Doesn't work when using with Astro components and slots -->
<div class="space-y-4">
  <Component client:load />
  <Component client:load />
</div>
```

The reason is simple. Iâ€™ve wrote about the cause in [a previous article](/blog/overcoming-astro-styling-frustrations) and how to fix it.

You can read that article for more information, but the gist is:

1. Astro components and slots wrap itâ€™s contents in a div that has `display: contents`
2. The `* + *` selector, which Tailwind uses for its space utilities, cannot target the elements within these Astro components and slots

## A simple fix

Fixing this is simple. We just have to modify Tailwindâ€™s space utilities with a plugin â€” so they can dive one level beyond Astroâ€™s components and slots.

Iâ€™ve created this plugin and added it as part of Splendid UI. You can install it Splendid UI like this.

```shell
npm install splendid-ui
```

Then you can use the plugin in your Tailwind config file like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require('splendid-ui/tailwind/plugins/astro-space.cjs')],
}
```

(I know the path looks long and complicated right now. It's something I'll simplify in the future as Splendid UI becomes more mature. For now, just enjoy something that works! ðŸ™ƒ).

Thatâ€™s it!
