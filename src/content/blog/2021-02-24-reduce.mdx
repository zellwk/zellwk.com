`reduce` is an array method that helps you convert an array into a single value. It looks like this:

```js
const callback = (accumulator, currentValue, index) => {
  // return something here
}
const result = array.reduce(callback, initialValue)
```

- **initialValue** is the value you want to start with.
- **accumulator** is the value returned from the previous iteration. It will be `initialValue` for the first iteration.
- **currentValue** is array item in the current iteration.

Let's go through some examples.

## Summing numbers

Let's say you have a list of numbers. You want to find the total sum of these numbers.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Here's the code to sum the numbers.

```js
const total = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0)
console.log(total) // 15
```

Let's go through what happens, step by step.

First, you pass an `initialValue` to `reduce`. This `initialValue` should be 0 because:

1. We want `accumulator` to be a number.
2. We don't want the `initialValue` to affect the sum.

`accumulator` will be `initialValue` in the first iteration. `currentValue` will be the first array item.

<Image src="/assets/2021/reduce/sum-flow3.png" caption="currentValue is the first item in the array" />

You need to return a value in the callback. This value will be used as the next `accumulator`. Since we want to sum numbers, we return the sum of `accumulator` and `currentValue`.

`accumulator` takes on the returned value in the second iteration. `currentValue` will be the second array item.

We return the sum of the two values we have, `accumulator` and `currentValue`. This process goes on until `reduce` loops through the entire array. The final value will be returned to the function call.

## Reducing an array into an object

We'll create the `reduce` method together for this example.

Let's say we have an array of fruits. We want to know the number of each type of fruit.

```js
const fruits = ['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'orange', 'pear', 'apple']

// What you want
// {
//   apple: 3,
//   banana: 2,
//   orange: 1,
//   pear: 1
// }
```

First, we should pass an empty object as the `initialValue` because we want to create an object.

```js
const tally = fruits.reduce((accumulator, fruit) => {
  // Do something
}, {})
```

In the first iteration, `accumulator` will be `{}`. `fruit` will be `apple`.

In this first iteration, we know the accumulator doesn't have the fruit yet. (`{}` doesn't contain `apple`). Here, we want to add `apple` to `accumulator`. While adding `apple` to `accumulator`, we set the number of apples to 1.

```js
const tally = fruits.reduce((accumulator, fruit) => {
  return accumulator[fruit] = 1
}, {})
```

In the second iteration, `accumulator` takes on the previously returned value. `fruit` is another apple:

- `accumulator`: `{ apple: 1 }`
- `fruit`: `apple`

Here, we want to increase the number of apples in the `accumulator`. To do so, we need to check if the `apple` property exists in `accumulator`. If it does, we increase its value by 1.

```js
const tally = fruits.reduce((accumulator, fruit) => {
  if (accumulator[fruit]) {
    accumulator[fruit] = accumulator[fruit] + 1
  } else {
    accumulator[fruit] = 1
  }

  return accumulator
}, {})
```

That's it! The process repeats for other fruits. If you log `tally`, you'll see the object we wanted.

```js
{
  apple: 3,
  banana: 2,
  orange: 1,
  pear: 1
}
```

Let's clean up the reduce function next. We can do so with ternary operators.

```js
const tally = fruits.reduce((accumulator, fruit) => {
  const fruitCount = accumulator[fruit]
  fruitCount
    ? accumulator[fruit] = fruitCount + 1
    : accumulator[fruit] = 1
  return accumulator
}, {})
```

## Flattening an array

Let's say we have an array that contains arrays. We want to convert this array of arrays into a single array that contains all values. This process is called flattening.

```js
const array = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
]

// What we want:
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

To flatten the array, we need to start the `reduce` with an array. This is because we want the output to be an array.

```js
const flattened = array.reduce((accumulator, item) => {
  // Do something
}, [])
```

In the first iteration, `accumulator` will be an empty array. `item` will be an array that contains five items.

- `accumulator`: `[]`
- `item`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

We want to merge `item` into `accumulator`. We can use `concat` to do so.

```js
const a1 = []
const a2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const merged = a1.concat(a2)
console.log(merged) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This method works even if accumulator contains values.

```js
const a1 = [1, 2, 3]
const a2 = [4, 5]
const merged = a1.concat(a2)
console.log(merged) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The `reduce` code looks like this:

```js
const flattened = array.reduce((accumulator, item) => {
  return accumulator.concat(item)
}, [])
```

If you want to make it shorter, you can use the array spread operator.

```js
const flattened = array.reduce(
  (accumulator, item) => [...accumulator, ...item], []
)
```
