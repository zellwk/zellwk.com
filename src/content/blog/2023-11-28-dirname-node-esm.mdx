Getting the directory name (or short for `dirname`) is extremely simple in Node prior to ES Modules (ESM).

All we had to do was use the `__dirname` global variable.

```js
console.log(__dirname) // This will show the directory
```

Unfortunately, `__dirname` is not supported in ES Modules. So if we want `__dirname`, we need to use a rather round-about way to retrieve it.

## How to get dirname in ESM

The easiest way to get `dirname` in ESM is to use three utilities that Node provides us with

- `import.meta.url` — This gives you the file path to the current file
- `fileUrlToPath` — This strips away the `file://` protocol so the URL can be used in `path`.
- `path` — This is a utility you can use to specify paths in Node

The complete code looks like this:

```js
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'
import path from 'path'

const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))
```

This code can be really complicated to remember. So I abstracted it into a `dirname` function in [Splendid UI](https://splendidlabz.com).

## The easier way to get dirname

First, install Splendid UI.

```shell
npm install splendid-ui
```

Then import `dirname` from the `node` subpath.

```js
import { dirname } from 'splendid-ui/node'
```

Then you just have to pass the `import.meta.url` into `dirname` and you'll get the `__dirname` value.

```js
const __dirname = dirname(import.meta.url)
```

That's it!

I hope this makes things easier for you when using Node :)
