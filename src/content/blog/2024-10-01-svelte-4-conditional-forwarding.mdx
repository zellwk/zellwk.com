If you ever wanted to forward conditional slots up two component levels, you're out of luck.

{/* more */}

```svelte
<!-- Grandchild -->
<slot name="label" />
```

```svelte
<!-- Child -->
{#if $$slots.label}
  <slot name="label" slot="label" />
{/if}
```

Conditional Slot Forwarding is probably never gonna be a thing in Svelte 4.

[Tan Li Hau](https://github.com/tanhauhau) has created a [PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8304) to make this possible, but Rich Harris [closed the PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8304#issuecomment-2030741921), stating that snippets (a Svelte 5 feature that replaces slots) will resolve this use case.

We can only hope that Svelte 5 indeed solves this issue â€” and that porting over Svelte 4 code will not be too much of a pain!
