Time doesn’t heal any wounds. What you do with time determines whether (and how) your wounds heal. 

**Generally, infected wounds have a chance to heal when they're exposed. When covered, they fester.**

So the strategy for healing emotional wounds is simple: Face the truth, expose them, and let the skeletons out of your closet. 

Once you do this, behaviours can be forgiven, fears can subside, and change becomes possible — not forced. Then you can make any necessary amendments. 

Do this as little or as much as you’d like since healing accumulates.
