I acknowledge the irony that I'm announcing breaking changes just after ranting about breaking changes.

But, I believe it's important to let you know about breaking changes in advance so you can ease into the new library as much as possible.

{/* more */}

So here we go.

## Stuff that has changed (and why)

I'm still rebuilding the libraries for Splendid Labz based on breaking changes in Tailwind v4, so I won't be able to give you a complete breakdown on what has changed.

But I'm able to tell you about the biggest changes so far â€” and explain why we need to make these changes â€” so you'll get an idea about what's going on and why these changes had to be made.

Here are the major changes so far:

- Combining Splendid Layouts and Splendid Styles into a single library.
- Undoing the naming convention

## Combining Splendid Layouts and Splendid Styles into one library

If you have been following my sporadic articles about [Splendid Labz](https://splendidlabz.com) last year, you may have heard of [Splendid Layouts](https://splendidlabz.com/docs/layouts/getting-started/introduction/) and Splendid Styles.

The basic idea is this:

- Splendid Layouts gives you components and utilities that lets you build layouts easily and quickly.
- Splendid Styles gives you a scaffold that makes it easy for you to build sites â€” especially if you used the components I've built via Splendid Astro and Splendid Svelte.

I realize how confusing it can be for you to understand the difference between these two projects. So when I converted Tailwind from v3 to v4, I took the opportunity to combine the projects together into one.

I discovered this was a much better approach since I could now introduce Splendid Styles as a Tailwind-first library (in a non-traditional Tailwind sense).

### A Tailwind-first library

Splendid Styles is going to be Tailwind-first library going-forward, so it is best used together with Tailwind.

Two points I have to make on this here.

First: **I'm still adamant on making the library available for non-tailwind users**. So you have the option to do that too. (Don't worry about it, I'm not abandoning you traditional CSS guys).

Second: Even though Splendid Styles is Tailwind-first, it doesn't mean you should use it in the default Tailwind-fashion.

Truthfully, **Tailwind is horrible if you use it as-is**. But it can be amazing if you use it together with pre-made layout patterns because it makes your whole layout experience much easier, more straightforward â€” I'll show you a quick example about this below.

## Undoing my Naming Methodology

When I created Splendid Layouts, I recommended a naming convention that uses a mix of PascalCase and camelCase. [You can read more about the rationale here](https://splendidlabz.com/docs/layouts/concepts/naming-convention/).

```html
<div class="ComponentName-modifierName">...</div>
```

I still think this naming convention beats [traditional BEM](https://zellwk.com/blog/css-architecture-1/). But I have to undo this naming convention because it's not compatible with Tailwind 4. (More on this below).

## What lead to these breaking changes?

We're really diving into the nitty-gritty details here so have a cup of tea as you read through this section.

In a nutshell, Tailwind 4 is incompatible with the way I've built Splendid Labz with Tailwind 3.

In Tailwind 3, you could make a component inside CSS layers and Tailwind would pick that up as a valid components.

```css
/* Valid components in Tailwind v3 */
@layer components {
  .Horizontal {
    /* Make a horizontal layout */
  }
  .Vertical {
    /* Make a vertical layout */
  }
}
```

By valid, I mean Tailwind would pick those components up and let you use them with Tailwind's variants.

So if you wanted a simple layout that:

- is vertical on mobile
- is horizontal on tablet/desktop

You could use the `Horizontal` and `Vertical` components I've created like this:

```html
<div class="Vertical md:Horizontal">...</div>
```

Noticed something? You can can visualize what's going to happen as you read the HTML. This pattern is powerful because it's very visual â€” you can see, maintain, change, and edit it easily while still knowing what's happening almost all the time.

Unfortunately, this the naming convention no longer works in Tailwind 4 because they [stopped hijacking CSS layers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#adding-custom-utilities) (I didn't knew they did that ðŸ«£).

If you want to make a class work with Tailwind's variants in version 4, you need to create it as a Tailwind utility.

```css
@utility horizontal { ... }
@utility vertical { ... }
```

Notice I used lower-cased names (`horizontal`) instead of PascalCased names (`Horizontal`)? I did this because Tailwind enforced kebab-case naming conventions for the `@utility` feature... so this effectively broke [the naming convention](#undoing-my-naming-methodology) I suggested above.

Pity.

So, instead of writing the `vertical-to-horizontal` layout with PascalCase utilities, we're now forced to use kebab-cased utilities

```html
<div class="vertical md:horizontal">...</div>
```

It still works. It still makes sense. And it's not that big of a change for you ðŸ™‚ (even though reworking the while library was a [major change](/blog/breaking-changes-rant/) for me ðŸ¤¬).

On the bright side, this changed paved the way for me to create the new Splendid Styles completely with Tailwind. In doing so, I learned to take advantage of Tailwind's powerful `@apply` feature.

I'll talk about that in my next article.
