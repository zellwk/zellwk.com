Astro strips away query parameters from endpoints if you're in a static rendering mode. So, unless you're using SSR for all your pages, you'll need to ensure that your **endpoints are not pre-rendered**.

{/* more */}

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js title="endpoint.js"
// Make sure this is there
export const prerender = false 

// All your endpoints go here
export function GET () {/* ... */}
export function POST () {/* ... */}
export function PATCH () {/* ... */}
export function DELETE () {/* ... */}
```

This will save you lots of headaches when debugging Astro endpoints.
