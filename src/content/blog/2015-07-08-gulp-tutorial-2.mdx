Last week, we set up a simple gulp task to convert Sass into CSS. We also touched on how to watch the `styles.scss` file for changes and how to reload the browser automatically with Browser Sync.

In this article, we're going to dive further into the `sass` task to find out how to watch more than one file for changes, and how to customize options for the plugins that we have used.

Let's get started.

## Before you read this article

Make sure you've checked out the [first article](/blog/gulp-tutorial/) before continuing on to this article. We're building up on what we have made previously.

A key thing about build workflows is that you'll often need to watch more than one file.

Let's begin here.

## Watching more than one file

You'll need to use a `glob`, a matching pattern for files, to watch more than one file. The idea of a glob is similar to that of a regular expression, where you check if a file name has a specific pattern. Once the pattern is identified, we say that it is matched.

Most workflows tend to only use these 4 different globbing patterns. They are:

1. `*.scss` - The `*` pattern is a wildcard that matches any pattern in the specified folder. In this case, we're matching any files ending with `.scss` in the root folder.
2. `**/*.scss` - This is a more extreme version of the `*` pattern that matches any file ending with `.scss` in the root folder and any child directories.
3. `!not-me.scss` - The `!` indicates that Gulp should exclude the pattern from its matches, which is useful if you had to exclude a file from a matched pattern. In this case, `not-me.scss` would be excluded from a match.
4. `*.+(scss|sass)` - The plus `+` and parenthesis `()` allows Gulp to match multiple patterns, with patterns separated by the pipe `|` character. In this case, Gulp will match any file ending with `.scss` or `.sass` in the root folder.

We can use these globbing patterns in 3 different gulp methods. – `gulp.src`, `gulp.dest` and `gulp.watch`. Let's see how to place globs into these methods in our current `sass` task.

First of all, we may need to compile more than one Sass file into CSS within the `app/scss` folder. We can check for all `.scss` files by using the `**/*` pattern.

You might also have a mix of files ending with `.scss` and `.sass` in some projects. If that's true, you can also use the `+(|)` pattern to allow Gulp to match files ending with both `.sass` and `.scss`.

Here's how we can modify the `sass` task to include globbing:

~~~js
gulp.task('sass', function() {
  return gulp.src('app/scss/**/*.+(scss|sass)') // Gets all files ending with .scss or .sass in app/scss
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
    .pipe(sass())
    .pipe(autoprefixer())
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('app/css'))
    .pipe(browserSync.reload({
      stream: true
    }));
})
~~~

Our `sass` task should now pick up any additional `.sass` or `.scss` files we have in the `app/scss` folder.

So if you created a new `print.scss` file within `app/scss` and ran `gulp sass`, you should be able to see `print.css` file in `app/css`.

We want to add the same globs to our `watch` task as well so Gulp will automatically run the `sass` task if any `.scss` or `.sass` file is changed:

~~~js
gulp.task('watch', ['sass', 'browserSync'], function() {
  gulp.watch('app/scss/**/*.+(scss|sass)', ['sass']);
  gulp.watch('app/index.html', browserSync.reload);
})
~~~

Let's add globbing to reload the browser whenever any `.html` files are changed since we're now on the watch task:

~~~js
gulp.task('watch', ['sass', 'browserSync'], function() {
  gulp.watch('app/scss/**/*.+(scss|sass)', ['sass']);
  gulp.watch('app/*.html', browserSync.reload);
})
~~~

Now, Gulp will detect changes and reload the browser for all files ending with `.html`as well as `.scss` or `.sass` in the respective folders.

And that's everything you need to know about globbing to configure Gulp tasks for different folders in your project.

Let's find out how to change the default options for Gulp plugins next.

## Changing Plugin Options

Most gulp plugins can be customized to a certain extend if you passed an `options` object into them. Here's how a task would look like if the `options` object has been predefined:

~~~js
.gulp.task('task-name', function() {
  return gulp.src('source-files')
    .pipe(plugin(options))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('destination'))
})
~~~

If you were wondering, each `options` object is a JavaScript object that may contain one or more key-value pairs.

~~~js
// JavaScript Object
var options = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2
  //... Other key-value pairs
}
~~~

You don't necessarily have to create a separate options object for each gulp plugin. In fact, you can leave the options object within the gulp plugin itself:

~~~js
.gulp.task('task-name', function() {
  return gulp.src('source-files')
    .pipe(plugin({
      key1: value1,
      key2: value2
      }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('destination'))
})
~~~

Different plugins will contain different key-value pairs. Hence you'll have to read the plugin documentation if you want to customize them.

Let's use gulp-autoprefixer as an example as we walk through how to customize a plugin.

First, head over to [gulp-autoprefixer's documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) to find out what key-value pairs are available for customization.

At the documentation page, there's an example of how gulp-autoprefixer can be used with different options.

<Image src="/images/2015/07/autoprefixer-usage.png" alt=""/>

Perfect, so now we know that there are at least two keys for the gulp-autporefixer plugin, `browsers` and `cascade`, and what they do. There's also a third key, `browsers` as well.

<Image src="/images/2015/07/autoprefixer-descriptions.png" alt=""/>

We can also find out what values each key can take.

<Image src="/images/2015/07/autoprefixer-values.png" alt=""/>

The values for `cascade` and `remove` are `true` or `false` since they're Booleans. The `browsers` key, however, is not as straightforward as it seems, and we can find out more by clicking on the browsers link, which leads us to [autoprefixer's repo](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#browsers).

<Image src="/images/2015/07/browserlink.png" alt=""/>

We still don't know exactly what values the `browsers` array can take though. Luckily, there's another clue for us to find out more. Let's click on the [browserlist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist#queries) link.

<Image src="/images/2015/07/browserlist.png" alt=""/>

And here is the information we need for the `browsers` array.

It turns out that Gulp-autoprefixer depends on autoprefixer, which in turn depends on Browserlist. Open source tools work like this sometimes, and you'll have to dive further in to figure out certain key-value pairs.

We can finally customize the `browser` values now. If we wanted to prefix for both IE 8 and IE 9, plus 2 recent versions of all other browsers, we can simple set the `browsers` value to `['ie 8-9', 'last 2 versions']`.

Here's how it would look in the `sass` task:

~~~js
gulp.task('sass', function(){
  return gulp.src('app/scss/**/*.+(scss|sass)')
    //.. sourcemaps and sass
    .pipe(autoprefixer({
      browsers: ['ie 8-9', 'last 2 versions']
      }))
    //... other plugins
    .pipe(gulp.dest('app/css'))
});
~~~

Not too difficult was it? :)

All gulp-related plugins have the same configuration, so you can check out [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) and [gulp-sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps) to see their options object as well.

For now, let's try customizing another package that's slightly different – Browser Sync

### Customizing Browser Sync

Browser Sync has a [shitload of options to configure](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/). Instead of jumping in and reading every option in there, let's take a step back and first think about what kind of configurations we might need with browser sync.

We have already set up browser sync to spin up a server and serve `app` directory on `localhost:3000` when the `browserSync` task starts.

Sometimes you might want to run the server on a port other than 3000. We can configure the `port` key to do so.

~~~js
gulp.task('browserSync', function() {
  browserSync({
    server: {
      baseDir: 'app'
    },
    port: 8080
  })
})
~~~

Browser Sync will now spin up a server on port 8080 instead of 3000 once we set this configuration.

In some cases you might already have a server running with Mamp Pro or another method, and you want Browser Sync to run on that host instead.

You can configure Browser Sync to do so by using the `proxy` key instead of the `server` key.

~~~js
gulp.task('browserSync', function(){
  browserSync({
    proxy: 'local.dev'
    // Or if it's a localhost url:
    // proxy: 'localhost:8080'
  })
})
~~~

You'd also have noticed that Browser Sync automatically opens the default browser for you when the task starts. If you want Browser Sync to stop this behavior, or use another browser instead, you can change the `browser` key.

~~~js
gulp.task('browserSync', function() {
  browserSync({
    server: {
      baseDir: 'app'
    },
    // Opens Google chrome browser
    browser: 'google chrome'
  })
})
~~~

Finally, if the notification on the top right side of BrowserSync is irritating for you, you might want to consider removing it by setting the `notify` key to false.

~~~js
gulp.task('browserSync', function() {
  browserSync({
    server: {
      baseDir: 'app'
    },
    // Opens Google chrome browser
    browser: 'google chrome',
    notify: false
  })
})
~~~

Browser Sync provides lots of options to configure, if there's something you want to do, but isn't covered in this article, you might want to try looking at the [documentation directly](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/).

## Wrapping Up

These two articles would have taught you the very basics of Gulp. You've learned how to set things up, how to write a gulp task, use gulp plugins and find more information on each plugin you use.

Of course, there's still way more to Gulp than what was covered in these two tutorials, but with this knowledge you can go ahead and figure out what other gulp plugins might be great to add to your workflow.

Here are some ideas you'll want to consider for a great workflow:

- Creating CSS-sprites with [sprity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sprity)
- Compiling only files that have changed with [gulp-changed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-changed)
- Writing ES6 with [Babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-babel)
- modularizing JavaScripts with [Browserify](http://browserify.org)
- Modularizing HTML with Template engines like [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-handlebars) or [Swig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-swig)
- Image and SVG optimization with [imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin)
- Optimizing CSS and JavaScripts with [useref](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-useref)
- Removing unused CSS with [unCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uncss)
- Further optimizing CSS with [CSSO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-csso)
- Generating inline CSS for performance with [Critical](https://www.npmjs.com/package/critical)
- Deploying with [rSync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rsync)
- Chaining tasks together with [run sequence](https://www.npmjs.com/package/run-sequence)
- Splitting Gulpfile into smaller files with [require-dir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/require-directory)

To be honest that's a pretty big list of things you can do to setup your workflow. It can get overwhelming to set everything up if you're still new to it.

To help you out, I'm writing a book on [automating your workflow](https://automateyourworkflow.com) to help you dive even deeper into Gulp and add these awesome tools to your workflow in a simple, coherent manner.
