I've put in months of work into [Splendid UI](https://splendidlabz.com) by now, and I realised how difficult it is to create an Astro-first component library. 

The hardest part is designing the usage API.

Let's take a popover as an example. 

Popovers are simple. Most of the time, there are two elements you need to take care of: 

1. The popover trigger
2. The popover content 

There are three ways we can build an API to use a popover: 

1. With slots 
2. With an enclosing parent component 
3. Create a component for each element

```astro
<!-- Method 1: Using slots -->
<Popover>
  <div slot="trigger"> ... </div>
  <div slot="content"> ... </div>
</Popover>

<!-- Method 2: Enclosing parent element -->
<Popover>
  <PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
</Popover>

<!-- Method 3: Separate components -->
<PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
<PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
```

I've settled on using the 3rd method for components in [Splendid UI](https://splendidlabz.com) after much testing. Below is a story on how I reached this decision. 
## Complexities arise when hydrating components

Since I want Splendid UI to work with Astro's island architecture, each component in Splendid UI must be hydratable right from an `astro` or `mdx` file. 

This means the Popover component can look like these when it's used:  

```astro
<!-- Method 1: Using slots -->
<Popover client:load>
  <div slot="trigger"> ... </div>
  <div slot="content"> ... </div>
</Popover>

<!-- Method 2: Enclosing parent element -->
<Popover client:load>
  <PopoverTrigger client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
</Popover>

<!-- Method 3: Separate components -->
<PopoverTrigger client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
<PopoverContent client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
```

I felt the first method (with slots) looked the best at first since I only had to use one `client` directive. Unfortunately, slots turned out to be a really bad idea.

## Slots are a really bad idea because Astro handles slots differently from Svelte

I built most of my components on Svelte so this was a major factor. With the same HTML (below), Astro and Svelte produce slightly different results: 

```astro
<!-- Astro -->
<Popover client:load>
  <div slot="trigger"> ... </div>
  <div slot="content"> ... </div>
</Popover>
```

```svelte
<!-- Svelte -->
<Popover>
  <div slot="trigger"> ... </div>
  <div slot="content"> ... </div>
</Popover>
```

Astro produces HTML that contains the contents within an `<astro-slot>` element, while Svelte produces HTML directly.

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/astro-first-lib-challenge/svelte-slot.png" caption="Svelte slots does not produce a slot content element" />

I could use `Fragment` instead of `div` to produce better-looking HTML, but this produces a different HTML compared to Svelte's as well. 

```astro
<!-- Astro -->
<Popover client:load>
  <Fragment slot="trigger"> ... </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="content"> ... </Fragment>
</Popover>
```

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/astro-first-lib-challenge/astro-slot-2.png" caption="Astro slots with Fragment removes the div element from the slots."  />

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/astro-first-lib-challenge/svelte-slot.png"
caption="Svelte slots includes div element for each slot" />

Users will likely use Splendid UI components in both Astro and Svelte files. The difference in HTML is not acceptable — [it'll be confusing when styling the component](https://zellwk.com/blog/overcoming-astro-styling-frustrations/). 

So I'm left with two options: 

```astro
<!-- Method 2: Enclosing parent element -->
<Popover client:load>
  <PopoverTrigger client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
</Popover>

<!-- Method 3: Separate components -->
<PopoverTrigger client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
<PopoverContent client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
```

As I searched around the web for inspiration, I decided to try the second method (enclosing parent element). 

## Enclosing elements in a parent component worked, but it's not a great idea

Method 2 looks ugly at first glance since we have to hydrate the component three times, but there's a way to hydrate everything once. 

All we have to do is use the component in a `svelte` file and hydrate that svelte file. For example, say I have a `<Nav>` with lots of popovers, I can do it like this: 

```astro
<!-- page.astro -->
<Nav client:load/>
```

```svelte
<!-- Nav.svelte -->
<Popover>
  <PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
</Popover>

<Popover>
  <PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
</Popover>
```

I liked this method because I get to be lazy when I create the `Popover` — I can depend on `<Popover>` to find both `<PopoverTrigger>` and `<PopoverContent>`, so I don't have to link them up with an `id` attribute or something similar. 

```astro
<!-- Method 2 doesn't require me to specify the targets  -->
<Popover>
  <PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
</Popover>

<!-- Method 3 requires me to specify the target -->
<PopoverTrigger target="one"> ... </PopoverTrigger>
<PopoverContent id="one"> ... </PopoverContent>
```

**But I later realized two major downsides that led me to choose method 3 instead.** 

The first downside is I couldn't use Svelte's Context API to pass information from `<Popover>` into `<PopoverTrigger>` and `<PopoverContent>` if I hydrated them separately. 

That's because each component is hydrated in isolation so they won't be able to inherit context. 

This also meant the component could not be used in an `astro` file — which violates the Astro-first principle. (It was painful to discover this since I had to rewrite my code to support the 3rd method). 

```astro
<!-- You cannot use context when doing this -->
<Popover client:load>
  <PopoverTrigger client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
</Popover>
```

The second downside is the API isn't user-friendly even if we hydrate it once — it creates confusion instead. 

To illustrate this point, imagine I have a navigation that contains 3 items. Each item is a button that shows more items. 

If I used Method 2, the HTML would look like this: 

```astro
<!-- Nav.svelte -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <Popover>
				<PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
				<PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
			</Popover>
    </li>
    
		<li>
      <Popover>
				<PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
				<PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
			</Popover>
    </li>

    <li>
      <Popover>
				<PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
				<PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
			</Popover>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

This looks okay at first glance. But I was taken aback when I tried to refactor the code — I couldn't immediately grasp what `<Popover>` was; my mind was looking for a `<button>` element instead (which can be represented by the `PopoverTrigger` element). 

By merely removing the `<Popover>` container, the navigation immediately made much more sense. 

```astro
<!-- Nav.astro -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>
			<PopoverTrigger client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
			<PopoverContent client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
    </li>
    
		<li>
			<PopoverTrigger client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
			<PopoverContent client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

This is why I went with method 3. 

## The best API I could think of

The best API I could think of is Method 3 — where I create a separate component for each element. Then I would link them up together with an `id` attribute or something similar. 

```astro
<PopoverTrigger target="one"> ... </PopoverTrigger>
<PopoverContent id="one"> ... </PopoverContent>
```

Contrary to my expectations, I encountered two major challenges while building this API too. They are: 

1. Deciding how options should be passed into the component 
2. Linking the components up

### Deciding how options should be passed into the component 

If I used the second method, I could pass all the options into the enclosing parent component and call it a day. Easy peasy. 

```astro
<!-- I could do this if I used method 2 -->
<Popover options={{ ... }}>
  <PopoverTrigger> ... </PopoverTrigger>
  <PopoverContent> ... </PopoverContent>
</Popover>
```

Unfortunately, that's not possible in Method 3. 

I had to decide between three options: 

1. Pass all options into `PopoverTrigger`
2. Pass all options into `PopoverContent` 
3. Split options between these two components. 

I eventually decided to split the options into `<PopoverTrigger>` and `<PopoverContent>` because it made more sense. 

So the API became like this: 

```astro
<PopoverTrigger options={{ ... }} client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
<PopoverContent options={{ ... }} client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
```

To give you more context, you can pass *many* into Popover (and other components). I built these options to give you flexibility when using them. 

Here's an example of the options you could use: 

```js
export const defaultPopoverTriggerOpts = {
  showOnHover: false,
  showOnFocus: false,
  hoverCloseDelay: 120,
  closeOthers: true,
}

export const defaultPopoverContentOpts = {
  placement: 'top',
  arrow: true,
  arrowWidth: '0.5rem',
  offset: '0.25rem',
  closeOnOutsideClick: true,
  closeOnEscapeButton: true,
  trapFocus: false,
}
```

Separating options into two components means I have to change the way I write documentations. They had to be clearer so it's not confusing for users. That'll be the next challenge I have to overcome. 

### Linking components up was hard 

You would expect linking up two components would be easy. After all, they're hydrated one after another. Right?

```svelte
<PopoverTrigger client:load> ... </PopoverTrigger>
<PopoverContent client:load> ... </PopoverContent>
```

Turns out, it was hard because the components are hydrated asynchronously — I have no idea which would be hydrated first. 

I eventually found a way to overcome this problem by initializing components into a store and overwriting options as necessary. I shall not dive into the technical details here since it can be quite complex and unnecessary for users. 

## Wrapping up

Phew, this turned out to be a long article explaining how I went about designing the APIs for [Splendid UI](https://splendidlabz.com). 

As I build Splendid UI, I find myself respecting framework authors and library authors more because this kind of work is really complex. 

At the same time, I feel incredibly fortunate that I'm building Splendid UI, because I get to create the perfect library for frontend developers who pay attention to both design and accessibility.
