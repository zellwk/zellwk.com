Recursion happens when a function calls itself over and over.

A function that calls itself over and over is called a recursive function. Here's an example of a recursive function:

```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello world')
  helloWorld()
}
```

(Don't try this code because your browser would hang). I'll explain how you write a proper recursive function and why you may want to use one.

## Loops and Recursions

A recursion is a `while` loop that's written in a slightly different way.

A `while` loop looks like this:

```js
while (condition) {
  // Stuff to do
}
```

If you want to write a `while` loop that runs forever, you can pass in a `condition` that always evaluates to `true`.

```js
while (true) {
  console.log('Hello world')
}
```

This will produce lots of `Hello world`s in the console. It will also hang your browser because the function calls itself too quickly and too many times.

If you write a function that calls itself, you've effectively written the infinite `while` loop.

```js
// Same result as the infinite while loop above
function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello world')
  helloWorld()
}
```

## While loops the right way

If you want the `while` loop to end, you need to change the condition so it evaluates to `false` sometime later. For example, let's say you want to run the loop 3 times. You may write something like this:

```js
// This logs three `Hello world` statements in the console.
let count = 0
while (count < 3) {
  console.log('Hello world')
  count = count + 1
}
```

You can apply the same logic to recursive functions.

```js
// Loop three times only
let count = 0
function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello world')
  count = count + 1
  if (count < 3) {
    helloWorld()
  }
}
```

## Recursions without external variables

We don't need to declare `count = 0` upfront. We can pass `count` into the recursive function directly as an argument.

```js
helloWorld(0)
```

We can use the variable inside the recursive function like this:

```js
function helloWorld(count) {
  console.log('Hello world')
  count = count + 1
  if (count < 3) {
    helloWorld()
  }
}
```

## Recursion without hardcoding

We hardcoded three loops into `helloWorld` since we used the number `3`. If we want to let the user control how many times to loop, we hardcode this value. We need to use a number passed in by the user.

Here's an example of what the user would pass in:

```js
// This should log five 'Hello worlds'
helloWorld(5)
```

In this case, the argument becomes the number of times we want to loop.

```js
function helloWorld(timesToLoop) {
  // ...
}
```

After logging `hello world` each time, we want to decrease `timesToLoop` by 1.

```js
function helloWorld(timesToLoop) {
  console.log('hello world')
  timesToLoop = timesToLoop - 1
}
```

Eventually, `timesToLoop` will get to `0`.

- If it gets to `0`, we do nothing. The recursion ends here.
- But if `timesToLoop` is NOT `0`, we need to run `helloWorld` again.

```js
function helloWorld(timesToLoop) {
  console.log('hello world')
  timesToLoop = timesToLoop - 1

  if (timesToLoop === 0) {
    // Do nothing
  } else {
    helloWorld(timesToLoop)
  }
}
```

## Returning values from recursive functions

If we want to return a number from a recursive function, each branch in the `if` statement should return a value.

- At least one of these branches should end the recursion
- At least one of these branches should call the recursive function

```js
function recursiveFunction(parameter) {
  if (condition) {
    return value // Ends recursion
  } else {
    return recursiveFunction(/*...*/) // Continues recursion
  }
}
```

## Working through an example

Let's say you want to create a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number. (This is the classic example used for recursive functions).

Here's how factorials work. (Note: Factorials are written as `!` in math):

- `1!`: `1 = 1`
- `2!`: `1 * 2 = 2`
- `3!`: `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`
- `4!`: `1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 6`

To calculate the factorial of a number, users insert the number into the function.

```js
factorial(4) // Should produce 24
```

Since we want `4!`, it makes more sense to invert the calculation (like what we did with `timesToLoop` above.

- `4!`: `4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6`
- `3!`: `3 * 2 * 1 = 6`
- `2!`: `2 * 1 = 2`
- `1!`: `1 = 1`

There's a case where we don't have to continue the recursion anymore. This is often called the **end state**. In this case, the condition is `n === 1`. When `n === 1`, we always return the number `1`.

```js
function factorial(num) {
  if (num === 1) {
    return 1
  }
}
```

Let's continue to look at the rest of the numbers:

- `4!`: `4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6`
- `3!`: `3 * 2 * 1 = 6`
- `2!`: `2 * 1 = 2`

Now imagine we passed `4` into the function. To get `4!`, we need to multiply `4` by `3!`:

- `4!`: `4 * 3!`
- `3!`: `3 * 2!`
- `2!`: `2 * 1!`

Notice we're multiplying `num` by the factorial of `num - 1`? We can put this observation into the `factorial` function.

```js
function factorial(num) {
  if (num === 1) {
    return 1
  } else {
    return num * factorial(num - 1)
  }
}
```

We can clean it up slightly with [early returns][1].

```js
function factorial(num) {
  if (n === 1) return 1
  return num * factorial(num - 1)
}
```

## Recursions without end states

Not all recursions need end states. This is true when the recursion happens infrequently enough that it doesn't hang the computer. One example is when you use `requestAnimationFrame`

```js
// Snippet from CSS-Tricks
function repeatOften() {
  requestAnimationFrame(repeatOften)
}

requestAnimationFrame(repeatOften)
```

Chris Coyier went ahead and created a demo of this in his [article on `requestAnimationFrame`][2].

## Summary of recursions

Recursions are functions that call itself over and over again. Most recursions require an end state (like `factorial`).

Once in a while, you'll find recursions that work slowly (enough) not to require an end state (like `requestAnimationFrame`).

## When should you use recursion in JavaScript?

Recursion looks fancy, but [they perform worse compared to `for` or `while` loops][3], so I'm not exactly a fan of recursion.

Personally, I find `while` loops easier to write and I would prefer using `while `for simple use cases. I would then fish out recursive functions if `while` become too complex.
