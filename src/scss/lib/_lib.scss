// ==========
// LIBRARIES
// ------
// This file is for you to import other libraries that
// you would like to include into your project.
//
// I chose to include all my project dependencies with Bower.
//
// To install libraries with Bower, open the terminal and type
// `bower install <package-name> --save` and it will be automatically
// installed in app/bower_components.
//
// If you want to use Bower, you must have node.js and bower installed
// in your system.
//
// Node.js - http://nodejs.org
// Bower - http://bower.io
//
// If you are not comfortable with Bower, feel free to add new
// libraries into the libraries folder in any way you like.
// Then, import those libraries in the file here.
