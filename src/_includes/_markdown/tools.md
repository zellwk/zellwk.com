## For Development Work

- **Text editor:** I recommend [Visual Studio Code][1].
	- It's easy for to setup and maintain.
	- I created a [video series][2] to help you get started with Visual Studio Code if you're new.
	- I [customised Visual Studio Code shortcuts][3] to make my workflow more effective.
- **Theme:** I use [Night Owl][4] theme.
	- it has excellent contrast.
	- Sarah put a [lot of work][5] thinking about how she uses colors vs italics.
- **Fonts:** I use [Operator Mono Screensmart][6].
	- Other good font choices are [Jetbrains Mono][7] (free) and [Dank Mono][8] (40 Pounds)

Here's what my text editor looks like:

- **Terminal**: I like to use Visual Studio Code integrated terminal whenever I can.
	- If I need more space, I'll whip out [iTerm2][9].
- **Git**: I use Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal whenever I can.
	- I whip out [Tower][10] when things get complicated. You can get 20% off the first year of Tower with `zell20`.
- **Database**: [MongoDB Compass][11] is great for checking data in MongoDB. It works for both local and remote databases.
- **Hosting**: I host most of my sites on [Digital Ocean][12].
	- I use [Netlify][13] for sites that don't need a backend.

## For Writing

- **Text Editor**: [Ulysses][14] is the best text editor for Mac.
	- [iA Writer][15] is a good second choice.
	- [Visual Studio Code][16] works when I need to do code-related stuff
	- I purchased a [Setapp][17] subscription because Ulysses is in it. With this subscription, I get lots more tools to use (as you'll see below).
- **Emoji**: [Rocket][18] is hands-down the best emoji picker for Mac.
- **Editing**:
	- [Hemingway][19] helps me prune sentences
	- [Grammarly][20] helps me check for grammar and spelling mistakes
- **Screenshot**: I use [Cleanshot]() over Mac's default screenshot taker.
	- It's faster
	- It cleanups the desktop.
	- I get Cleanshot via [Setapp][22].
- **Annotation**: I annotate screenshots with [Skitch]().
	- Skitch is easier to use compared to Cleanshot.
- **Video capture and GIF makers**: [Kap]() is the best video capture out there.
	- It's easy to use
	- It's output (both `.mp4` and `.gif`) are smaller than others I've seen
	- Kap doesn't capture device audio
	- When I need to capture device audio in my videos, I use [Capto]() (which comes with [Setapp][26]).

## For Design

- **Design**: I use [Sketch][27].
	- I'm considering [Figma][28] going forward.
- **Font Management**: I need a good font tool because I bought a huge number of fonts from [Designcuts][29].
	- I tried [Fontbase][30]. It's okay, but it doesn't let me search according to Serif/sans-serif etc.
	- I also use [Typeface][31] because it comes with [Setapp][32].
	- Still looking for a better font manager.
- **Color Picker**: [Sip][33] (via [Setapp][34]) is a great color picker tool.
	- It lets me check color-contrast against accessibility guidelines.
- **Color Palette**: I create color palettes with [this method][35].
	- This [Color shades generator][36] is helpful as a starting point.
- **Measuring**: If I need to measure distance of stuff on screen, I use [PixelSnap][37]. (Comes with [Setapp][38]).

## For my Business

- **Email List**: I use [Convertkit][39] to send emails. It has the best UX and interface compared to others I've tried.
- **Payment provider**: Currently I use [Gumroad][40].
	- It lets me sell through in USD and keep $$ in USD.
	- Doesn't handle limited subscriptions well (like 12 payments of $XX)
	- Looking for a better payment provider.
- **Managing Money**: Gumroad transfers money into Paypal.
	- I use [Transferwise][41] to convert USD to SGD because it has better rates.
- **Scheduling**: I use [Calendly][42] to schedule calls.
	- It lets people choose an empty slot from my calendar.
	- Works great especially if I work with people from a different timezone.

## For Streaming

- **Streaming App**: I use [Open Broadcaster Studio]() (OBS) to stream.
	- It's the only decent app you can use on Mac.
- **Camera**: [Logitech C920][44] because it's cheap and good.
- **Microphone**: My setup contains 4 things:
	- [Yeti Blue Microphone][45]
	- With a shock mount (like [this one][46])
	- And a [ RODE PSA 1 Boom Arm ][47]
	- Plus a cheap pop filter (like [this one][48])
	- You need all 4 pieces for good audio 😢.
- **Setup**: I use [Switchem][49] (via [Setapp][50]) to open all my apps. It's buggy though.

## File Storage and Backups

- [Dropbox][51]: For files that require good syncing capabilities and speed
- Google [Backup and Sync][52]: For less essential stuff
- Google [Drive File Stream][53]: For syncing business related stuff
- [Backblaze][54]: To backup all my projects (because they have large `node_modules` folder). Backblaze backs EVERYTHING up.

## Mac Stuff

Lots of stuff here.

- I use [Endurance][55] (via [Setapp][56]) to extend battery life.
- I use [Tripmode][57] (via [Setapp][58]) to save mobile data.
- I use [Clean my Mac X][59] (via [Setapp][60]) to remove unwanted files.
- I use [Bartender][61] (via [Setapp][62]) to cleanup menu bar icons
- I use [Alfred][63] over Spotlight
- I use [BusyCal][64] (via [Setapp][65]) as my calendar.
	- Fantastical was better, but they decide to start charging monthly so <div class="kaomoji">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div>.
- I use [Moom][66] to manage windows placement on Mac.
	- Setapp has [Mosiac][67] that does the same thing.
- **Email**: I used to use Airmail.
	- But they screwed it up with animations.
	- Looking for a better alternative
- **Todolist systems**: Major pain point here.
	- I tried Anydo, Asana, Notion, Things, Trello, Todolist, and many others.
	- But none of them work for me.
	- Thinking about building a Todolist system. Interested to hear more? Let me know!
