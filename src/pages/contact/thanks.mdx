I just want to let you know that I've received your message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Please note that I might be slow to respond — I usually take between 3 to 5 days to respond to emails, but I can take up to 2 weeks if you catch me in the middle of a deep-work phase.

So, if you need a quicker response, please nudge me gently by sending another email. Thanks!
