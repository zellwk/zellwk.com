Welcome to my little place on the internet. I've been designing and building websites for a few years. I had the privilege to:

1. Help over 100,000 developers a month through [my articles](/blog).
2. Make super in-depth courses like [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.today) and [Mastering Responsive Typography](https://mastering-responsive-typography.com).
3. Give talks at conferences (like [this](https://vimeo.com/194962824) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fdIva47wZE)) and workshops in lands far away from where I live (a tiny country called Singapore).

## Here's a little story of how I got started.

People think you need degrees to "make it" as a designer or developer. You don't. I started with nothing.

- No computer science degree
- No design degree

I came from a Finance background. I was afraid to code. **I thought coding was something I would never be good at** (even if I died trying 😨).

I only started learning to code at 25 years old (one year before I graduated from university) because I didn't want to work in a bank when I graduated.

**I found a freelance job 10 months after I started learning to code** (while I'm still in school!). And I freelanced ever since then.

## That's crazy!

Yup! I know! It's been a hell of a ride. Here's two more things I never imagined I could do (but I went ahead did them):

- Wrote a programming book 2 years after I started coding 😱
- Gave a talk at a conference 3 years after I started coding 😱

**It's amazing how far you can go when you don't stop yourself.** You're much better than you think you are. This statement is for both of us.

My story just proves that **you can learn to design and code too.**

## How I can help you.

I taught myself how to design and code. It was HARD. So I understand what you're battling with: Lots of information and no direction.

Don't worry, I'm here to help.

First, **I know a lot about the web** since I've worked in it for so long. I constantly reinvent my techniques as new technology appears, and I'm more than happy to share my technqiues with you.

Second, **I'm insanely practical.** I only teach techniques and frameworks that I use. If you're worried about keeping up, just stay along with me and I'll help filter the important stuff from the fluff.

Third, **I write concise and clear tutorials**. I explain all fundamental concepts and jargons you need to know. I'll help you bridge the beginner-advanced gap so you level up enough to explore the advanced zone without feeling lost and intimidated.
