              I'm a developer who's in the process of creating sustainable businesses that jive with the way I work. I'm exploring what that means, while being careful not to land myself in burnout like my previous business. 

              I'm also deeply interested in psychology + human development. Over the years, I've spent over $100k --- primarily with an organization called Live Your Mark --- and they've helped reshaped the way I think about many other aspects of life like enjoyment, money, and relationships. 

              I'm interested in marketing too. As proof of that, I've also sunk more than $50k learning about marketing.

            Unfortunately, sales dwindled because I went dark for a while, so
            I'm no longer one of the top searches on Google. It's difficult to
            get that back, especially in the AI age, so I'm pivoting to
            different business model. Wish me luck!

            I've been thinking about what to do ever since AI began to take over the planet. (Let's face it, it's here). At the very least, AI has cannibalized my course business --- anyone can ask AI about code, so few people would buy another coding course. 

            So I'm back in exploration mode. 

            And here are a few things that I'm looking into:

            1. Creating unique courses where AI cannot replicate (like <strong class="text-zpurple-500">Unorthodox Tailwind</strong>).
            2. Building a component library (<strong class="text-zorange-500">Splendid Labz</strong>) that'll help me ship projects faster.
            3. Deep diving into AI to see what I can make out of it.
            4. Building applications and making businesses out of them
            5. <strong class="text-zred-500">Coaching people</strong> to help them unblock themselves and unravel their potential in life.

            Ultimately, I'm looking to create sustainable and thriving businesses that works for me. I don't think I'd ever want to stop growing, so I'd probably never stop exploring too.
