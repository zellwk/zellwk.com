Thanks for being part of the community, and I hope our paths cross again in the future.

If you have unsubscribed by mistake, please feel free to [sign up for the newsletter again](/newsletter/) .

## What happens next?

Since you are unsubscribed, you won't receive any newsletter emails from me.

You will, however, still receive support emails from products that you have purchased — this just ensures that I can continue to serve you well. If you wish to opt out of those emails, [just let me know](/contact/).
