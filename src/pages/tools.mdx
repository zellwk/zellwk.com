This page contains a list of tools I use for my work. It may contain some affiliate links. If you purchase something through these links, I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.

## For Development Work

- **Text editor:** I use [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) over [Visual Studio Code][1] nowadays because the AI features within Cursor are much better than VSCode's.
  - I still recommend VSCode for new developers because it's free and easy to get started. (Cursor builts on top of VSCode anyway).
  - By the way, I created a [video series][2] to help you get started with Visual Studio Code if you're new.
  - I have also [customised Visual Studio Code shortcuts][3] to make my workflow more effective. (These work with Cursor too).
- **Theme:** I use [Twilight Cosmos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zellwk.twilight-cosmos-theme) (made by yours truly).
  - Before that I've used Moonlight 2 Italic and Night Owl.
- **Coding Font:** I've used [Jetbrains Mono][7] (free) for a long time now and I prefer it over pricer options like [Operator Mono Screensmart][6] and [Dank Mono][8] (40 Pounds).
- **Terminal**: I tend to use [iTerm2][9], but the integrated terminal in Cursor / Visual Studio Code is great too.
- **Git**: [Tower][10] is my choice for this. Get 20% off the first year of Tower with `zell20`.
- **Database**:
  - I've switched over to SQLite ever since I started using Astro. If you're using SQLite, [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com) lets you check your SQL data. This is bundled with [Setapp](17). (More below about Setapp below).
  - MongoDB is good, but it gets complex. If you're using MongoDB, [MongoDB Compass][11] is a great app for viewing your data.
- **Hosting**:
  - I host most of my sites on [Digital Ocean][12]. It's [cheaper than Netlify or Vercel](/blog/netlify-vercel-digital-ocean/) for higher traffic sites that consume more bandwidth.
  - I use [Netlify][13] for client sites that don't need a backend, or if they have lower traffic

## For Writing and Editing

- **Text Editor**:
  - I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for a while and I like it very much — more than [Ulysses][14] and [iA Writer][15] — because I can store all my notes and writing in one place. (No more switching between many apps!)
- **Emoji**: [Rocket][18] is hands-down the best emoji picker for Mac.
- **Editing**:
  - [Hemingway][19] helps me prune sentences
  - [Grammarly][20] helps me check for grammar and spelling mistakes
- **Screenshot**: I use [Cleanshot](https://cleanshot.com/) over Mac's default screenshot taker.
  - It's faster
  - It cleanups the desktop.
  - I get Cleanshot via [Setapp][22].
- **Annotation**: Cleanshot has a built-in annotation tool that's good enough for most use cases.
- **Video capture and GIF makers**: Recently, I've been using Cleanshot for this as well

## For Design

- **Design**: I use [Figma][28].
- **Font Management**: [Typeface][31] is currently my favourite font manager. (It comes with [Setapp][34] too).
- **Color Picker**: [Sip][33] (via [Setapp][34]) is a great color picker tool.
  - It lets me check color-contrast against accessibility guidelines.
- **Color Palette**:
  - I rely on my gut feeling and experience so I no longer use tools to generate color palettes nowadays but I'm open to suggestions if you have any.
  - I write colors in `oklch` format. [oklch.com](https://oklch.com/) is useful for converting between `hex` and `oklch`.
- **Measuring**:
  - If I need precise measurements between things on my screen, I use [PixelSnap][37]. (Comes with [Setapp][38])
  - If a rough gauge would do, I just take a screenshot and examine subtract the crosshair numbers 🙃.

## For Life and Business

- **Email**: I use Gmail. No other email client seem to be a good fit nowadays.
- **Todolist systems**: I built my own system within Obsidian. Other systems don't seem to work for me with the way I manage stuff.
- **Email List**:
  - I use [Sendy](https://sendy.co/?ref=TqTIn) nowadys.
  - I've tried [Convertkit][39] and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/refer/splendidlabz) previously but they got really expensive really fast. They're good when you're starting out though.
  - Sendy costs $1 for every 10,000 emails sent - and $0 if I don't send anything.
- **Payment provider**:
  - I used [Thrivecart](https://zellwk--checkout.thrivecart.com/thrivecart-pro-account/) for a period of time.
  - Nowadays I alternate between [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-sg) and [Thrivecart]()
- **Currency Conversion**:
  - I use [Transferwise][41] to convert USD to SGD whenever possible because it has better rates
- **Scheduling**: I use [Cal](https://cal.com) to schedule calls because it's free.
- **Video calls**: Google Meet is my go-to for video calls.

## For Streaming

- **Streaming App**: I use [Open Broadcaster Studio]() (OBS) to stream.
  - It's the only decent app you can use on Mac.
- **Camera**: [Logitech C920][44] because it's cheap and good.
- **Microphone**: My setup contains 4 things:
  - Shure SM7B -[DM1 Dynamite inline preamp](https://seelectronics.com/products/dm1/)
  - [Audient ID4](https://audient.com/products/audio-interfaces/id4/overview/) Audio Interface
  - [ RODE PSA 1 Boom Arm ][47]
  - Plus a cheap pop filter (like [this one][48])

## File Storage and Backups

- [Dropbox][51]: For files that require good syncing capabilities and speed
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com): For less essential stuff
- [Backblaze][54]: To backup all my projects (because they have large `node_modules` folder). Backblaze backs EVERYTHING up. (It's a lifesaver for the occassional faulty Mac models)

## Mac Stuff

Lots of stuff here.

- I use [Endurance][55] (via [Setapp][56]) to extend battery life.
- I use [Tripmode][57] (via [Setapp][58]) to save mobile data.
- I use [Clean my Mac X][59] (via [Setapp][60]) to remove unwanted files.
- I use [Bartender][61] (via [Setapp][62]) to cleanup menu bar icons
- I use [Alfred][63] over Spotlight
- I use [BusyCal][64] (via [Setapp][65]) as my calendar.
- I use [Moom][66] to manage windows placement on Mac.
  - Setapp has [Mosiac][67] that does the same thing.
