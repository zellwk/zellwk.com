      <h1>Freebies</h1>

      <p>We're happy to give you free chapters to our courses.</p>

      <p>
        Take your time to read through them. They'll help you clarify concepts
        you need to know about each topic — which will help you understand,
        know, and be able to build anything you want using the topics you're
        interested in.
      </p>

      <p>
        More freebies are coming soon. <a href='/newsletter'
